This work started many years ago as an analysis or survey of sorts into ancient wisdom to ascertain what if 
anything could be gained or learned regarding the so-called "mystical arts", what is referred to in modern 
academic circles as mysticism, that could perhaps facilitate their study in modern academic disciplines (the 
Academy) as it relates specifically to the seemingly unbridgeable gap between Science and Religion. As a 
byproduct, and perhaps for our own edification, we also thought that the exercise itself could also perhaps 
bear fruit for a more personal exploration of the same topics, shedding light on a seemingly intractable 
subject by looking at it through the eyes of the very first philosophers, before "objectivity" carried the kind of 
weight and import that it does today.  And so began a long journey through many ancient civilizations, 
through many ancient texts, following the thread of philosophy up until the modern era, what we refer to 
throughout as the Quantum Era, in the end yielding the work as it stands today.
One of the most remarkable things that one finds after having studied these ancients texts for so many years, 
and in reading various translations and interpretations thereof from authors and philosophers from both the 
Western and the Eastern traditions, is how easy it is to get lost in the "facts" surrounding these ancient 
works, and by so doing lose sight of their true meaning and import to the individuals who wrote these 
ancient works, some of the very oldest extant works in existence in fact.  Much of the modern academic and 
scholarly literature about these ancient texts, what we refer to throughout as "theo-philosophy" to illuminate 
not only their philosophical content but their implicit theological import as well, particularly in the Western 
academic tradition, falls into this category.  
As such, in a certain fashion, and quite unintentionally in fact, one of the major themes of at least the first 
portion (Parts I and II) of this work, is to try and recover the true meaning - the purpose or intent - of this very 
ancient material, much of which represents some of the very first detailed musings regarding the nature of 
reality and the origins of existence.  To do this, we use what you might call a multidimensional approach that 
includes, but is not limited to, the following varying perspectives, each of which we like to think is unique 
with respect to much of the material that exists today regarding philosophy in antiquity:
i.	look at ancient philosophy within a much broader theological, mythological and philosophical 
narrative in antiquity as a search for a better understanding of the natural world as well as a search 
for meaning within it, 
ii.	look at ancient philosophy not as siloed within specific geographical or cultural areas in antiquity, but 
as reflective of a broader intellectual movement which runs parallel to the revolutionary 
advancements of civilization itself throughout what we refer to as Eurasia, a geographic area which 
includes not only Northern Africa, i.e. Egypt, but also the Mediterranean (the ancient Greeks and 
Romans), the Near East (Sumer-Babylonia and ancient Persia), and also the Indian subcontinent and 
the Far East, i.e. China, 
iii.	looking at ancient philosophy within the context of an intellectual progression which is preceded by 
myth and ritualistic worship (our mythos) and then crystalizes as philosophical literature proper (our 
logos) in the so-called "Axial Age" which in turn provides the foundation for theology proper (our 
theos) as it manifests with first Christianity and then Islam, the two most dominant forms of 
monotheism that exert profound influence throughout the geographic are in question not only in 
antiquity but through the Middle Ages up until the Enlightenment Era, 
iv.	looking in depth at the intellectual and specifically Scientific advancements of the Enlightenment Era 
and the Scientific Revolution as rational outgrowths of this ancient wisdom and philosophical 
tradition, exploring in depth the ancient philosophical foundations which provide the semantic and 
philosophical basis for 20th century Science, Newtonian Mechanics, Relativity and Quantum Theory in 
particular, and finally 
v.	reorienting this ancient wisdom within the context of the Quantum Era, an era which is characterized 
by Science, capitalism and from a philosophical perspective rests upon the principles of what we 
refer to throughout as causal determinism and objective realism - principles which are 
extraordinarily powerful with respect to providing the foundations for the revolutionary 
technological and scientific advancements which mark our age but which also sit in stark contrast to 
some of the theological, and inherently mystical, beliefs that are so characteristic of ancient man and 
which also sit at the very heart of Eastern philosophy even in its more modern variants.

By establishing this much broader perspective on intellectual advancements of modern man, which are 
rooted in antiquity more so than we typically consider, we hope to expand not just our understanding of 
wisdom and knowledge in toto, but also establish the grounds for a new intellectual paradigm that at least 
has the potential to support our needs as a global community in the 21st century and beyond.  For despite all 
of our advancements in Science in the last few hundred years, we are still rooted in a fundamentally 
reductionist way of thinking, a perspective that is characteristic of the "West" in fact, and given the success 
and proliferation of this ideology to almost every corner of the globe in the modern era - our Quantum Era - 
has resulted in some very significant problems and challenges for the global community (global warming, 
wealth inequality, etc.) which this ideology as it turns out is wholly inadequate and unprepared to address.
In order to accomplish this, we take a primarily intellectual journey through the mind of ancient man, 
focusing on how he sees the world as is reflected in the earliest literary evidence we have, trying to 
understand these works not only within the broader "Eurasian" context, but also trying to look at them 
through the eyes of the ancient philosophers, theologians, priests and scholars who wrote these ancient texts 
(or in many cases were the ones to "compile" or "transcribe" these longstanding theo-philosophical 
traditions) themselves within the context of the socio-political  theological environment within which these 
works were created.  This broader meaning we refer to as knowledge, which from a modern Philosophical 
perspective at least is referred to as epistemology.
This knowledge that we are trying to capture and reorient within the context of this work is what Philo 
Judaeus takes great pain to describe in his exegesis of the Pentateuch (Genesis in particular), what the Neo-
Platonists take pains to describe in their literature which flourishes just as Christianity takes root and begins 
to supplant and snuff out their schools of learning and wisdom, it is what is alluded to in the so-called hidden, 
or unwritten, teachings of Plato and that which is hidden, kept secret, by the followers of Pythagoras  and 
also in the Eleusinian Mysteries and the alchemical Hermetic doctrines attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, 
and also what the Upanishads  refer to as Brahmavidyā, or knowledge of Brahman, that from deep antiquity 
is believed to be passed down from teacher to disciple - as Plato refers to in his Seventh Letter as that which 
is "brought to birth in the Soul, as light that is kindled by a leaping spark, and thereafter nourishes itself." 

This work in its current form is to a large degree an outgrowth and evolution of the intellectual journey that is 
documented and mapped in the Snow Cone Diaries, and in particular an outgrowth of research done after 
Snow Cone Diaries was written exploring the nature and origins of early Hellenic philosophy and its 
relationship to early Chinese philosophy as well as ancient Vedic or Indo-Aryan philosophy as reflected 
primarily in the Upanishads, the latter of which was rigorously and systematically studied at the 
Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York under the guidance of Swami Adiswarananda to whom this 
work is dedicated to.  However, having said that, while this work can at some level be considered to be 
extensive revision and expansion of the academic and intellectual pursuits that are reflected in the Snow 
Cone Diaries, it is distinctive in terms of scope, breadth and skill and much more "academic" in the sense that 
it represents a much higher level of scholarship than is reflected in the Snow Cone Diaries, having put to rest 
(God rest his Soul) our dear Charlie. . Given the breadth of the material covered in this work, the author in no 
way intends to represent it as an exhaustive study of any of the specific topics that is covered herein.  In fact, 
each Chapter or section of the work could be covered, and is covered, in much greater length in a variety of 
works that are cited as references and for further study and research.  The author has however taken great 
pains to try and refer to, and directly cite, the most influential and comprehensive works that cover the 
various topics in question and of course the interested reader can follow these lines of inquiry and these 
references to learn more about any given topic.  
The specific source material that is used is not only cited directly throughout as footnotes, but is also covered 
from a much broader perspective in the Sources and Bibliography section at the end of the work.  Perhaps 
more so than other works from before the 21st century, an era the author refers to as the "Quantum Era", 
this work stands directly on the shoulders of many academics and scholars that have toiled and taken great 
pains to open up the world of antiquity to the modern Western reader and scholar through countless 
translations and historical books and records, many of which are now electronically available and upon which 
easy access the author has greatly relied.  There are no doubt particular sections or chapters which the 
author has glossed over in a manner that may be considered to be "superficial", particularly by academics 
and scholars who have spent the better part of their professional careers studying and writing about the 
specific topics in question.   However, each of the lines of thought represented in each Chapter of each Part 
of this work represent a coherent and cohesive whole and in their entirety, and of course for the sake of 
brevity (as ironic a term that may be given the length and scope of this work), is intended to show as 
complete a picture as possible in one text.
The approach from a reference and bibliography standpoint is to have significant footnotes and references 
directly within the material itself rather than, as is the case with most academic works, at the end of a 
chapter or even at the end of the work.  The footnotes, the explanations and small intellectual excursions 
which are reflected in the extensive footnotes that are included directly in the text not only serve to give 
credit to the reference material and the work and analysis put in by other academics and scholars on whose 
research and work mine ultimately depends and builds upon, but also as sidebar notes that may be of 
interest to the reader that provide direct links and references to works that the reader can refer to if they are 
interested in a certain topic that is not covered in detail in this work.    The footnote style that is used is 
essentially adopted from the writings of Swami Nikhilananda (1895 - 1973), one of the foremost Sanskrit and 
Vedic scholars in the West in the 20th century.   Nikhilananda's works have in no small measure influenced 
the author, as he studied at the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center which he founded in the middle of the 
twentieth century which was led by the author's teacher, Swami Adiswarananda from 1973 until his passing 
in 2007. 
In this context, Vedānta, and more broadly what we refer to as "Indo-European philosophy"  in this work, is a 
central and constant theme throughout this work, in particular with respect to the modern conception of 
ancient Indian philosophy as it is presented in the teachings and works of Swami Vivekananda (1863 - 1902), 
one of the foremost proponents and most influential of the modern "Indian philosophers".   From the 
author's perspective, Vedānta, as reflective of one of, if not the, oldest and richest of the Indo-European 
theo-philosophical traditions, can (and should) be leveraged as an intellectual and theo-philosophical 
benchmark of sorts for the recasting of the definitions of knowledge and reality in the West, one of the main 
thrusts of this work. 

The work is divided into 5 major sections, Books or Parts, following more or less the intellectual development 
of mankind since the dawn of "history" - history in this sense being marked by the invention and widespread 
use of writing after which we have a "direct" or "first hand" exposure to the mind of man, or at least into the 
minds of the authors of the works that are covered herein.  
I.	On Creation Mythology (mythos): a look at the ancient mythological traditions, what we call 
mythos, in antiquity throughout Eurasia, with a particular focus on cosmogonic and theogonic 
accounts, i.e. how the universe and its primordial deities or forces came into existence, 
II.	On Ancient Philosophy (logos): a look at the first ancient philosophical traditions from throughout 
Eurasia, focusing on the Hellenic, Indian and Chinese traditions in particular and focusing on 
ontological, epistemological and theological questions primarily, 
III.	On Religion and Science: looking at how ancient mythos and logos transformed into what we today 
call Religion and Science, focusing on the Hellenic philosophical tradition primarily, and Aristotle 
specifically, and its evolution or transformation into Judeo-Christian, and Islamic, monotheism, as 
well as specific advancements in 20th century Science such as Relativity and Quantum Theory, 
IV.	On Ontology and Mysticism: a deeper and more comprehensive look at the nature of reality 
understood through the lens of modern Science which is juxtaposed with the view held by Eastern 
philosophy, i.e. mysticism, 
V.	On Metaphysics and Theology: a comprehensive look at various alternative ontological paradigms 
which (attempt to) explain reality as we understand it in the Quantum Era, ultimately proposing a 
new paradigm which incorporates Philosophy, Psychology, theology and mysticism - our so-called 
Metaphysics of Awareness

The chapters and sections in each of the respective Parts, or Books, are designed and written to be modular 
as much as possible.  By "modular" we mean to say that they are written with the intention, again as much as 
possible, of being stand-alone essays or dissertations of their respective topics such that the reader can read 
a particular chapter without necessarily reading preceding chapters.  That is to say, the design of the work 
itself is such that it need not be approached or "read" in a sequential fashion from start to finish.  And as 
such, some material and content is repeated in the various sections and Parts of this work so that said 
"modular" design is achieved.  Given the breadth of the topics covered herein, this type of modular design is 
not only intentional but is almost required in order for the work to have value.  For if it is not read, it of 
course cannot have the intended impact or influence on modes of thinking which to a large extent the 
intended purpose of the work.
One of the main underlying themes of the work, especially in Parts I and II, is an exploration and analysis of 
the potentially shared origins of not just the mythology, or mythos, of the first "civilized" peoples in Eurasia, 
which we refer to throughout as the "Laurasian" mythos hypothesis, a term coined by Dr. Michael Witzel, the 
renowned Sanskrit scholar and mythological historian from Harvard University, but also an expanded version 
of said hypothesis which discusses the potential shared the origins of not just mythology of these ancient 
peoples, but also philosophy itself in its earliest forms that we find throughout the earliest extant literature in 
Eurasia, what we refer to as theo-philosophy throughout.  Parts I and II of this work are primarily focused on 
this area in history, the 3rd to 1st millennium BCE when we have introduced into the historical record evidence 
and documents that outline the mythos of these early Eurasian peoples, specifically the creation narratives 
(what we refer to as cosmological or theogonical narratives), which is followed by a detailed analysis of the 
subsequent theo-philosophical tradition which emerges from, and is fundamentally and intrinsically related 
to, the underlying comsogonical narrative, i.e. again the respective mythos.
Part III focuses on intellectual developments that take place in the West post classical antiquity from the 
intellectual developments that characterize Hellenic philosophy, through the advent of more orthodox 
religious or theological developments, straight through the Enlightenment Era and Scientific Revolution 
periods of Western intellectual history where effectively the worldview is overturned and Science, as we 
define it in more modern terms, begins to eclipse the dogmatic religious and theological worldviews that had 
dominated the intellectual landscape in the West for some thousand years prior, the so-called "Dark Ages".  
Part III then goes on to look at Scientific developments in the 20th century, Relativity Theory and Quantum 
Mechanics in particular, which call into question our modern (and pervasive) notions of deterministic, 
objective based frameworks of reality, what we refer to collectively as objective realism, which represent 
from the author's perspective a somewhat unintended byproduct of the Scientific Revolution and which, 
given their limitations with respect to understanding reality - really being, or ontology - from a 
comprehensive or holistic perspective, require - in the same intellectual spirit and intent pursued by Kant, 
Pirsig and other post Enlightenment Western philosophers - a wholesale revision in order for not only the 
two theoretical pillars of modern Science (Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics) to be understood in 
any meaningful way, but also such that the knowledge and wisdom of the East is integrated into our 
conception and understanding of reality as well. 
Part IV covers in detail much of the material that was first introduced in Snow Cone Diaries with respect to 
the fundamental incompatibilities of Quantum and Classical Mechanics, going into (theoretical) detail not just 
with Relativity but also Quantum Theory, as well as some of the philosophical, and ultimately metaphysical, 
implications of Quantum Theory, covering two interpretative models in particular that the author thinks are 
relevant to the ontological questions that are the topic of Part IV - namely the relative-state formulation of 
Quantum Mechanics by Hugh Everett as well as the pilot-wave theory that is attributed to Louis de Broglie 
and David Bohm.  The Metaphysics of Quality as presented by Robert Pirsig is also offered up as an alternate 
model for ontological inquiry given its adoption and incorporation of the direct perception of "intuitive" 
reality directly into its metaphysics as it were.  Part IV then offers up various alternative interpretations of 
reality that attempt to present and synthesize what we understand about the nature of reality both from a 
scientific perspective, as well as from what we might term a mystical or spiritual perspective, models which 
directly incorporate experiential reality into account when defining reality or the extent of knowledge itself, 
i.e. what is referred to as epistemology in modern philosophical nomenclature.  The models and analysis in 
Part IV directly take into account the role of active consciousness, cognition and perception, what in 
Quantum Theory has come to be known as the act of observation which from a Scientific perspective, at least 
again from the author's standpoint, must be taken into account in any formulation of reality and in any 
definition of knowledge.  The alternative approaches to defining reality and knowledge that are presented 
and described in Part IV basically synthesize typically "Eastern" and "Western" worldviews, and from the 
author's standpoint, are far better suited than existing philosophical or religious intellectual frameworks to 
prepare us not just as individuals to survive and thrive in the modern, Quantum Era, but also are much better 
suited to serve the society as a whole, from a national as well as global perspective, given the level of 
interdependence and interconnectedness of not just the human race, but also the natural world within which 
we live and depend upon for our survival moving forward into the future. 
The last several chapters of Part IV, much more so than the author originally intended in fact, are dedicated 
to a fairly lengthy discussion of a relatively modern debate surrounding different ways or approaches to 
interpret, how best to understand, the life and teachings of the 19th century Bengali (Indian/Hindu) sage 
Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, a tradition of course to which this author is closely linked from a theo-
philosophical perspective.  Ramakrishna in this sense, and how he is perceived and approached in these final 
chapters of this work, is the full manifestation of, and in turn the perfect example of, the limitations of 
Western "thinking" and the implicit epistemological restrictions and assumptions that while true, are 
fundamentally limited in their capacity to deal with anything that falls outside of the realm of Science proper 
and as such is dealt with as a case study of sorts for the need to integrate the Science of the mind as it were 
into any ontological framework that we are to choose that would include the knowledge of the East along 
with the knowledge of the West.  This so-called mystical, or supraconscious experience, which is the intended 
result of the practice of the ancient art of meditation as it has been passed down to us through various 
classically Eastern theo-philosophical traditions - in the Upanishads in particular but also implicit in the 
writings and teachings of Plato and Greek Eleusinian mystery and Orphic traditions and of course in the 
teachings of Buddha as well - are presented as a necessary and integral component of any "redefinition" of 
reality and knowledge which, following any sort of rational interpretation of Quantum Theory must take into 
account the role of the observer and the act of cognition i.e. perception, into account in any coherent and 
complete model of reality.  Along these lines, various intellectual frameworks and models which include 
direct experiential reality are explored and discussed at length in Part IV, with specific chapters dedicated to 
the re-interpretation of Upanishadic philosophy as presented by Vivekananda in the early 20th century as well 
as an objective analysis of the experiences and interpretation of the life of Paramhamsa Ramakrishna in 
particular who according to tradition of course was the primary influence and inspiration for Vivekananda's 
teachings and life in general.  This analysis of course lends itself to one of the core and final arguments of this 
work, namely that the intellectual and metaphysical model that is applied to reality in the West, i.e. our 
ontological framework, while being extraordinarily powerful from a natural philosophical perspective, i.e. 
Science, is in fact an inadequate conceptual framework for the comprehension of the full scope of reality and 
therefore  is in need of wholesale revision and/or significant expansion and extension metaphysically and 
theo-philosophically speaking in order to support a more broad definition of reality through which a more 
complete and fuller understanding of existence itself can be at least approached.  
Part V concludes the work, outlining and summarizing the various philosophical and metaphysical models 
that we have covered throughout the work, and then finally offering up an alternative model - what we call 
the Metaphysics of Awareness - to address the specific needs and requirements of the Quantum Era as well 
as providing a philosophical framework within which not only Western and Eastern philosophy can be seen as 
complementary domains of knowledge, but also through which Psychology and mysticism can be better 
understood not as subjective experiences but as fundamental ontological truths.  In many respects, this new 
metaphysics is the culmination of the work, bringing together themes and disciplines explored in Parts I and II 
of the work regarding Eurasian philosophy - ancient mythos (ancient mythology, specifically ancient 
cosmogony and theogony narratives), logos (ancient philosophy), and theos (ancient theology) - and the 
themes explored in Parts III and IV of the work which follow the evolution of ancient wisdom and knowledge 
into the modern, Quantum, Era as they now stand in the fields of Philosophy, Psychology, Physics (in its 
Classical and Quantum variants), and mysticism under a single metaphysical paradigm, an augmentation of 
Kant's cognitive framework, that we call the Metaphysics of Awareness.
When we speak of ontology, we refer to a designation of a specific discipline within Philosophy unto itself - a 
relatively modern one, with its first use of the term coming only (according to the Encyclopedia Britannica) in 
the early 17th century by the German philosopher Jacob Lorhard (Lohardus) who used the word in Latin 
ontologia.  This of course derives from its Greek (compound) counterpart - óntōs which means "being" or 
"that which is"  combined with logos to mean "study of", or "science of".  In a broader sense however, and 
converting the somewhat obtuse "being" into a (somewhat) more modern and understandable English 
equivalent (reality), ontology is the study of the nature of reality, even though again it is more technically 
accurate to say "being" but once you go down this road you have already entered the gates of ontology as it 
were.  To clarify its usage, the oft quoted famous Shakespearean phrase "to be or not to be, this is the 
question" is in fact an ontological question, in that it relates to being as a concept in and unto itself, and 
therefore as such its answer, if there is one, would lie in the domain of ontology.  However, this really only 
scratches the surface for the Greek óntōs, in particular in the Hellenic philosophical tradition, is a very loaded 
word/term, resting at the very heart of the Hellenic philosophical tradition itself.  It is explored perhaps most 
prolifically of course through Aristotle and Plato, both of whom used the term óntōs in some form as the 
basis for their respective ontology as it were. 
So we start by going back to the beginning as it were, trying to ascertain where and how this unbridgeable 
gap between Religion and Science came from, trying to understand how the ancients conceived of it.  And 
what we found, as a sort of intellectual accident as it were, was that Witzel's Laurasian mythos hypothesis 
seems to hold a good deal of water as it were.  That is to say, the underlying cosmologies of the various 
ancient peoples, or at least what we know of them when we start to see the advent of writing in the 
archeological record from the 2nd millennium BCE onwards, all seem to have some very basic qualities.  
Namely that we start with a notion of chaos, or a watery abyss of sorts, and from there two basic principles 
act upon each other - principles which are represented by dark and light, male and female attributes 
respectively, and from this basic interaction we then have various basic primordial components or materials 
of the universe which emerge, the proverbial arche , upon which is superimposed a notion of order.  But we 
take this basic Laurasian mythos hypothesis one, or several steps further.  First after careful analysis and 
consideration, we find that the hypothesis can, and should, be extended to include philosophy, or theo-
philosophy which is the term we prefer to use, as well as mythos, or in particular creation mythos which is 
the area of concern for Witzel at least.  We find that the early theo-philosophical traditions across all of 
Eurasia share many common characteristics, enough common characteristics in fact that we argue that the 
best explanation for this commonality is some sort of shared common origins.  
This argument as it were starts with the analysis of, and ultimate categorization of, the theo-philosophical 
traditions that we find in antiquity from the Indian subcontinent all the way West to the Mediterranean and 
even to Northern Africa as sharing a variety of common characteristics, much of which stem from the fact 
these theo-philosophical systems emerge from, or more likely are co-existent with, the theological traditions 
from which they emerge.  To this extent we trace these similarities back through, and draw parallels to, 
philological studies which group virtually all of these peoples from a linguistic standpoint into one family and 
as such conclude that this family must have a common parent, namely the Indo-European language family.  
From here we show, and in particular as well look at Indo-Aryan, Zoroastrian, and Hellenic philosophy (in 
particular with Plato who represents the most comprehensive, early Hellenic philosophical system) and show 
that the similarities and parallels between these theo-philosophical belief systems are remarkably similar.  
Furthermore, we suggest that these similarities are not due to the Hellenic philosophers "borrowing" from 
the East (as is suggested by McEvilley or West or even Burkert for example), but that, like the philological 
theorists conclude, all share a common parent theo-philosophical system.  This hypothesis not only better 
explains their relationship to each other but it also explains why that direct contact between these peoples - 
the Indo-Aryans and the Hellenes in particular - is basically entirely missing from the early historical record.  
But we then extend this hypothesis regarding the shared origins of Indo-European philosophy to the Far East, 
effectively latching onto Witzel's Laurasian hypothesis but extending his hypothesis to include not just 
creation narratives or mythos, but also theo-philosophical traditions as well.  We do this by showing that this 
notion of chaos, or watery abyss features of the primordial beginnings of the universe, and the 
superimposition as it were by order on this chaos, and the basic primordial principles of male/female and/or 
dark/light from which the primordial arche are formed and out of which the entire cosmos or world order, 
which includes the world of man as well, can be found throughout all of Eurasia.  This is evident for example 
in not just the notion of the primordial abyss which we find prevalent in the Indo-European theo-
philosophical landscape, but which we find in the Far East as well, as seen in the notion of the cosmic egg 
mythical motif from which Heaven and Earth are born for example.  But this notion of divine or cosmic order, 
justice or truth even - Tiān to the ancient Chinese, Ṛta to the Indo-Aryans, Ma'at to the Ancient Egyptians, 
Aša to the ancient Persians/Iranians, and Nómos to the ancient Greeks and the Torah to the Ancient Hebrews 
and even the Dao of the ancient Chinese - is everywhere and represents the founding intellectual construct 
(or more aptly referred to as the founding theo-philosophical intellectual construct because in all of its forms 
it has specifically theological origins) upon which all of the theo-philosophical systems throughout Eurasia, 
which in turn form the basis of their socio-political structures as well, are effectively constructed upon.  
Furthermore, we postulate that the proper interpretation of these ancient cosmological narratives, leaving 
aside the historical manipulation of them by various dynastic rulers through antiquity , is not as 
"naturalistic" interpretations and explanations by primitive peoples to explain how the world was created 
necessarily, but as roadmaps to the essential nature of existence itself.  They are the mystical visions of the 
ancient shamans and priests which were codified into stories that were told and conveyed down through 
generations in language that people could understand, and conveyed in terms of divine principles and beings 
that the respective societies knew and understood.  
So these ancient myths, these creation narratives served a dual purpose - they bound the people together 
behind a common "story", a common "history" as it were that went all the way back to the beginning of time 
and the cosmos itself, and also at the same time encoded the divine mystery of the ascent of the Soul into 
the eternal and ever present substratum of existence itself, i.e. a guidebook to the mystic as it were.  The 
early philosophers, especially the Hellenic philosophers, understood this to a large extent and this is why they 
did not deny the truth of the ancient theological and mythical narratives which preceded them, they simply 
attempted to put them in a more rational context, or in the case of the Hellenic philosophical tradition in 
particular, attempted to provide a rational explanation of the cosmological world order which was 
independent of the mystical, or mystery tradition itself.  This is the origin of the Science and Religion split in 
the West.  The Indo-Aryans, the forefathers of the Hindus, did no such thing.  They again incorporated the 
mystical into their metaphysical frameworks.  The ancient Chinese for their part, much like Buddha did as 
well, punted on the whole problem of metaphysics and just described the various means by which, in a very 
practical matter, that enlightenment, nirvana, peace could be attained.  This is not only the essential 
characteristic of Daoism, but is also the very purpose of the Yìjīng, to bring one's life into balance with the 
cosmic order that underlies all things.  But they still nonetheless shared the notion of order itself, again Tiān, 
as well as the underlying dualism (Yīn-Yáng) from which the universe comes forth and is constructed and con 
be understood, as well as the basic elements from which universe is built upon and with (the Five Elements).
This of course forces ancient historians to take a closer look at this hypothesis of not just the common origins 
of the mythos of the peoples through Eurasia in antiquity but also at our understanding of ancient people's 
understanding of what this ancient mythos really meant, what it signified.  It also requires us to consider the 
possibility, again aligned here with Witzel, that the origins and age of not only these creation narratives but 
the ancient's understanding of these creation narratives, their interpretation as it were, may reach much 
further back in antiquity than we current consider.  If we follow the genetic record for example, we're looking 
at dates that reach back to 10,000 BCE for a a common source and heritage amongst these ancient peoples of 
Eurasia if we presume that the common origins hypothesis is the best possible explanation for all of the 
similarities that we find once the written record starts to appear.  For we know for certain that the written 
records reflect mush older belief systems, we just don't know how old these belief systems are and how far 
back into antiquity they reach back.  If we think this common origin hypothesis as we have formulated it, our 
so-called Laurasian hypothesis, here holds water, we're looking at a much deeper place in antiquity from 
which these ancient belief systems are sourced.  It's from this analysis that we not only conclude that this 
ancient mythos, with all its similarities and common motifs, not only is derived from a common source rather 
than through any sort of cultural diffusion, but that this ancient knowledge that we find spread across Eurasia 
also found its way into the earliest philosophical traditions in antiquity - that we find in ancient Greco-
Egyptian culture, the Indo-Aryans and Indo-Iranians in the Near East and the Indian subcontinent, and then 
even as far East into ancient China, i.e. the "Far East".  It's this leap from mythos to logos, combined with our 
Laurasian hypothesis that we extend to philosophy (logos) as well as mythology (mythos), from which we 
establish the notion of Eurasian philosophy - a shared set of philosophical motifs and themes that represent 
an extension of the ancient cosmogonies and theogonies that supported all of these ancient civilizations in 
deep antiquity, in pre-history, that found their way into the first true analytical and rational philosophical 
frameworks that crop up throughout Eurasia after the proliferation of writing, in the so-called Axial Age of 
man.  This effectively covers Part I and II of the current work.  
Parts III and IV intend to show how we in the West have come to this great intellectual divide between 
Religion and Science, where mysticism lacks objective reality, and is therefore incapable of being described or 
defined from any sort of classically modern Western, Scientific, intellectual framework and as such rests 
outside of our conception of knowledge itself, i.e. what modern philosophers refer to as the discipline of 
epistemology.  Mysticism at best from this vantage point is considered to be an "Eastern" phenomenon, or 
from a Western standpoint falls under the domain of Religion and is considered to be another term used to 
describe an altogether religious experience, and therefore rests outside of the domain of any sort of Western 
intellectual inquiry, i.e. Science.  We show how we arrived at this point, following the thread of Hellenic 
philosophical inquiry through to its ultimate eclipse by Christianity and Islam, and how after the Scientific 
Revolution and the advent and adoption of heliocentric models of the universe which were followed by the 
developments of twentieth century Science which rest on the twin, somewhat irreconcilable and 
fundamentally incompatible pillars of Relativity Theory and Quantum Theory, we find ourselves having to 
question the very nature of reality itself as we have come to understand it through the lens of Physics, the 
academic and (Western) intellectual discipline that has arisen as the domain within which our understanding 
of reality is based - one which again rests squarely upon the notions of objective realism and causal 
determinism.  In Parts III and IV of this work, we cover not only these twentieth century scientific 
developments, but discuss in detail what these underlying basic assumptions are which govern this 
perspective on the nature of reality, i.e. its underlying ontological assertions, but also look at in detail which 
of these assertions in particular are called into question, i.e. the notion of local realism which is a specific 
underlying tent of objective realism and causal determinism and the crux of the issue when trying to bridge 
the gap between Relativity Theory and its notion of gravity as the curvature of spacetime and Quantum 
Theory with its inherent "non-Classical" characteristics which are referred to in the scientific literature as the 
uncertainty principle, the so-called measurement problem, as well as the notion of complementarity and its 
close corollary entanglement.   
We cover various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics which attempt to address these issues in some 
detail, at least within the context of Physics proper, notably those offered by Everett, de Broglie and Bohm 
which provide not only various, alternative interpretations of Quantum Theory - what it really means or 
implies about the nature of reality, or again its ontological implications - but also in some cases systems of 
metaphysics which provide the basis for which these two seemingly incompatible models of physical reality 
can be understood in a cohesive, and somewhat complementary manner.  In this context, we review 
Everett's notion of the Universal Wave Function, his so-called metatheory, as well as de Broglie-Bohm theory, 
aka the pilot-wave theory, as well as Bohm's notion of holomovement as well as a system of metaphysics 
which Bohm refers to as the implicate and explicate order.  However, while these perspectives do somewhat 
address the problems facing modern Physics with respect to how to reconcile Classical Mechanics with 
Quantum Mechanics, or at least offer up some explanations or intellectual frameworks within which these 
seemingly incompatible models can be reconciled somewhat, we nonetheless no doubt find ourselves in a 
fundamentally ontological quandary that originates from the fundamental assertions and assumptions that 
we have compiled about the nature of reality in the last few centuries, many of which have been almost 
inadvertent acquisitions in many respects.  
Regardless, what should be abundantly clear from this analysis of the irreconcilable differences between 
Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics, and various proposed explanations and interpretations 
thereof, is that our basic definitions of reality and knowledge in the West, definitions which rest upon the 
notions of objective realism or causal determinism as we define them in this work, are in need of wholesale 
revision and/or expansion.  Furthermore, we assert that as we revise and expand such definition of reality 
and knowledge, we should include not only account for all models of physical reality as defined by modern 
Physics, but also include the inherently subjective and yet also at the same time verifiable notion of the so-
called mystical experience - an experience which is given epistemological significance in the Eastern 
worldview is effectively defined as the direct perception of the very ground of existence itself.  It is this 
assertion, this ontological problem as it were, that is explored in great depth in Part IV of this work which not 
only outlines the various interpretations of Quantum Theory, but also goes into some depth on the (what he 
deems at least to be) "pure" rational philosophy offered up by Kant where he subsumes Religion, Science, 
morality and ethics under reason itself into a single intellectual and metaphysical framework which has come 
to be known as transcendental idealism, as well as a review of modern conceptions of mind, i.e. Psychology, 
as framed by Freud and Jung specifically which effectively define the modern Psychological intellectual 
landscape as it were.
The rest of Part IV includes a detailed review of the classical, orthodox, Indian philosophical metaphysical and 
theological frameworks of Vedānta and Yoga, primarily viewed through the lens of Swami Vivekananda, 
arguably the most influential expositioners of Indian philosophy in the West in the modern era, as well as 
Patañjali from which Yoga as a philosophical system is established in the latter part of the first millennium CE.  
This foundation is then used to illustrate, in somewhat exhausting detail, the problems and pitfalls of trying 
to interpret, or understand, the vast range of what we refer to as supraconsciousness experiences that 
surround the life of perhaps the most well documented and studied mystics of the modern era, i.e. 
Ramakrishna Paramhamsa using a Western intellectual lens - in this case primarily a Freudian psychological 
one.  Part V again summarizes the metaphysical and ontological landscape, and then - building primarily off 
of the work of Kant - establishes the foundations for a new metaphysics, the Metaphysics of Awareness, 
through which not only can Eastern and Western philosophy be bridged, but Psychology as well, offering up 
unique insights not only into the rational foundations for theology, but a psychological interpretation of 
mysticism in general. 
In brief then, from the author's perspective at least, this work represents a unique contribution to the 
longstanding intellectual - really rational or philosophical - tradition that is associated with modern man, i.e. 
homo sapiens or "thinking man", in the following different dimensions - a must for any philosopher's library, 
philosopher in the ancient Hellenic sense as a (true) lover of wisdom.

i.	Compendium of Knowledge: The work as a whole is not intended to read from start to finish, and is 
intended to be a compendium of sorts for the intellectually curious or philosophically minded in the 
Quantum Era.  As such the vast wealth of information herein is designed to be approached not only 
from the detailed Table of Contents - by subject matter area, topic from start to finish, or linearly - 
but also by topic or theme via the Index as well, allowing for a multi-dimensional approach into the 
body of knowledge since the dawn of civilization aligned with tagging, indexing and searching 
technology that is one of the hallmarks of the Information Age,  
ii.	Eurasian philosophy: As an overview and introduction to philosophy in antiquity, and with respect to 
the Hellenic, Indian and Chinese traditions in particular, this work is worth its weight in gold (and its 
heavy), again from the author's perspective at least.  Nowhere else have I seen such a wide swath of 
coverage, at the level of detail and specificity, of philosophy in antiquity as is covered herein.  This 
journey follows the linguistic roots (philology) as far back as they can go, through the Proto-Indo-
Europeans, following core mythos, cosmogonies, into the Neolithic reaching into the Upper 
Paleolithic even - aligning mythos with ancient human migration patterns, following Witzel, and 
concluding that our ancient ancestors, even before there was writing, were philosophers 
nonetheless.  One of the primary driving forces for the creation of the work in fact, was to cover this 
ground from this broad Eurasian perspective that had not been done before, establishing a new 
category of philosophy that covers all of the philosophy in antiquity across Eurasia, i.e. Eurasian 
philosophy,
iii.	The Laurasian hypothesis:  :  As a somewhat unintended byproduct of ii, what we end up concluding 
after our analysis and review of mythos and philosophy in antiquity across Eurasia, is that philosophy 
as a discipline and practice, seen as the application of reason or logic upon natural phenomenon, 
dates from much further back in time, from deep in pre-history (before writing) in fact - this is what 
we call the Laurasian hypothesis, effectively pushing the existence or development of philosophy and 
theology as rational disciplines much further back in time than is normally considered in the standard 
orthodox view of the history of civilization, particularly from a Western perspective as is reflected in 
academia.  Within the context of this Laurasian hypothesis, we see philosophy as an evolution of 
mythos - conceived of as logos - rather than a revolutionary change in thinking as we typically see it 
in the context of the study of (Western) civilization in antiquity.  Looking at philosophy and theology 
(as they were not distinct from each other in antiquity by any measure) through not only a wider 
historical lens, but also a wider geographical lens, provides a sort of triangulation effect, drawing out 
patterns and commonality in the ancient traditions, ancient mythos, that would otherwise not be 
seen or found, that in fact remain hidden within the traditions themselves.  And lastly, 
iv.	Metaphysics of Awareness:  As a byproduct of ii and iii, and in the spirit of focusing on solutions 
rather than criticism of those who have come before us - intellectual giants all of them, those that 
are covered in this work - we offer up a way of recovering this vast reservoir of human knowledge 
that has been lost and remains hidden, by establishing a new metaphysics specifically designed for 
the Quantum Era to address the unique problems of our time, the Metaphysics of Awareness, that 
does not throw out the baby with the bathwater so to speak, but builds off of the currently well-
established philosophical model in the West that was put forth by Kant at the end of the 
Enlightenment that effectively provides the foundations of Western philosophy as they stand today.  
We extend this system, adding a metaphysical construct, Awareness, that bridges the gap between 
Physics, Psychology, Eastern and Western philosophy, Religion and Philosophy and recovers this lost 
wisdom, our dear Sophia, placing her at her rightful place at the top of the intellectual paradigm as it 
were, revealing her in her full glory not as some mystical fantasy, bit as the very height of the (Divine) 
Intellect, as she was conceived of as Athena to the ancient Greeks, the Hellenes, from which it all 
really began really, in Athens with the drinking of some hemlock by a self-proclaimed philosopher, 
the one who knew nothing and yet knew everything, so long ago...

At some level, a religious tradition can be thought of as distinguished by, or even defined by, its creation 
story - i.e. its cosmological narrative - and the Hindu/Vedic tradition is no different in this regard although it 
has many nuances and variances that distinguish it from Western theological traditions.  If we approach the 
mythology as codified in the Hindu literature with an open mind - and myth in the Hindu tradition runs very 
deep - we can see strong undercurrents of Vedic philosophy from within the creation narratives themselves, 
speaking to the importance of philosophy from the very earliest texts we have from the tradition.  The deep 
philosophical history of the Indo-Aryans, what we today call Vedānta (which Yoga is very closely related to 
and from which Buddhism emerged), ultimately sprung forth from these ancient creation stories, the 
mythological tradition as it were, which in turn yielded over time an in depth, scientific and analytical 
approach to the nature of mind and its relationship to liberation and experience of the divine which forms 
the basis of Yoga in all its forms.  
When one looks at the early creation mythos of the Indo-Aryans, the first Hindus, one is confronted with the 
fact that their early mythology was not so clearly codified or synthesized as its sister cultures in Mesopotamia 
and Egypt, and certainly not as well codified and standardized as the mythology and cosmogony of the 
Greeks and Romans.  This was somewhat odd, especially given that the extant Sanskrit literature from 
antiquity was fairly extensive, but it's important to keep in mind that the creation mythology of the Hindus 
was spread throughout a few different texts and traditions, as found in the Rigvéda, The Laws of Manu and 
the Purāṇas for example.  Brahman, as conceived by the early Hindus as reflected in the Upanishads, is a self-
evident construct that was is not just as old as civilization itself, it is in fact as old as mankind and is the 
source of life.  The ancient Vedic religion from which Vedānta emerged was steeped in ritual no doubt, 
consistent with all of the hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world and from which modern civilization 
eventually evolved, but the essence of the rituals was not lost and the highest form of teaching in the Vedic 
tradition was not the rituals per se, but the meaning behind the rituals, an idea that was part of the tradition 
itself since inception.  
While the Hindus kept their various gods and goddesses, they also held true to the messages of the great 
rishis of old and laid out perhaps a sophisticated system of psychology, theology and metaphysics whose 
ultimate objective was the realization that God - Brahman - did in fact exist, could in fact be realized just as 
clearly as the realization of the world of objects all around us are realized by our (physical) senses, and that in 
fact we as humans were fundamentally designed for this realization, our individual consciousness being 
simply a reflection of this broader sometimes anthropomorphized principle of the universe, i.e. Brahman.  
According to the Hindu faith, this heaven on earth so to speak was the birth right of all of us - no passage or 
gateway or ticketing required.  The authors of Vedic scripture in fact took pains to apply as systematic and 
comprehensive an intellectual framework as possible, alongside guidelines on morality and ethics that were 
based upon virtues like justice and duty, in contrast to its Western religious brethren that laid out more 
specific rules of conduct that were baked into the fabric of the theology - a trademark of Judaism and Islam 
and a source of much of their rigidity and inflexibility to adapt to modern times in many respects.  Unique to 
the Hindu religious tradition which survives today, from which the ancient Vedic texts form the spiritual and 
ritualistic traditions, there existed not only the establishment of the authority of the Brahmins and their role 
as priests and the presider over religious ceremonies and rites which was a consistent feature of all ancient 
mythos, but also along with it, akin to the mystery cult traditions which flourished in areas of ancient Greek 
and Roman influence to the West, there existed a firm and well documented and thought out belief in the 
divine nature of the spirit, or Ātman, and its underlying unity with the penultimate creative principle of the 
universe, or Brahman.
When looking at the Indo-Aryan tradition, given its age and maturity and its fundamental belief and faith in 
the unity of man and the universe from which he emerged (unique to the Eastern religious traditions in 
general), a line can be drawn between creation mythos, aka cosmogony, and the philosophical underpinnings 
of the school of thought, or metaphysics as it were.  The connection between cosmogony and creation 
mythos, as well as philosophy, is quite direct in the Vedic/Indo-Aryan philosophical tradition and in some 
sense this distinguishes this tradition from most other theological and philosophical traditions from antiquity 
- and most certainly distinguishes it from Western theological traditions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam for 
example where philosophy and theology are very much subsumed and overwhelmed by scriptural dogma and 
law.  This delineation between philosophy and theology, philosophy and Religion really, is not nearly as hard 
cut in the Eastern philosophical tradition as it is in the West, or at the very least it can be said that the 
connections between the two seemingly distinct areas of study and concepts are more evident because they 
are not clouded within a tradition that is more focused on literal interpretation and the "word" rather than 
underlying "meaning".  
In Hinduism then, and in its branches like Buddhism (for Buddhism is to the Hindus what Judaism is to the 
Christians, Buddha was a Hindu like Jesus was a Jew) presumed this fundamental distinction between church 
and state, or perhaps more aptly put this individuation of theology.  The Hindus did not codify these 
separation principles into law per se, like the United States had done after centuries of religious persecution 
in the western world, but the principle of religious freedom represented a core, integral part of their culture 
just the same.  And from this social acceptance of the individual expression of the divine, many great sages 
and seers, also known as rishis , had been born over the centuries that personified this apex and goal of the 
Hindu religious system - namely the realization of the divine in this very life.  These were such historic 
personalities as Krishna Buddha, and Chaitanya , and modern day great sages like Ramakrishna, whose 
existence and their ability to practice freely what can only be considered radical forms of religious expression 
could only have been possible within the society and culture of the Hindus who had an implicit belief in the 
freedom of religious expression, a belief that went back thousands of years and had its roots in the ancient 
scriptures themselves, namely the Vedas.
These great sages, these rishis, personified the goal of oneness with the divine, the perception of the 
kingdom of heaven within, and realized the end of the Hindu scriptures.  And they all accomplished this in 
their own unique way, and yet at the same time each of them reestablished the validity of these ancient 
scriptures, renewing the people's faith in their content and precepts which had been born so many 
thousands of years prior.  To all of these great sages the mind and body, and reason and logic itself, was to be 
used to realize the truth of this oneness.  That was its sole purpose of existence.  This truth was the great gift 
that was handed down from the ages from the Vedas.  This approach, if it can be called that, is distinctive to 
Vedic and Hindu theology and is juxtaposed with what we find in the Judeo-Christian (and Islamic) tradition in 
the West where we see the myth and theological historical narrative encapsulated into a single book and 
single version (the Old Testament, Qurʾān, etc.), and even in Greco-Roman mythos where we find 
mythological lore encapsulated in single textual traditions attributed to single authors such as Hesiod's 
Theogony and Ovid's Metamorphoses.  When trying to understand the meaning and later interpretations of 
some of these ancient Vedic texts however, texts which included not just philosophical material but 
mythological material and details on ritual and sacrifice as well, it is critical to have some sense of context - 
culturally and socio-politically - to try and get to the true meaning and import of the texts and how they 
impacted and were part of the development of this rich philosophical tradition.
To be fair the delegation of philosophy as a discipline and practice, or way of life, to religion, theology and 
faith in the "Word" is a somewhat later development in the West, aligned with the preeminence of the 
Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity as a systematic faith with approved scripture along with their 
associated approved interpretations of fundamental theological narratives (the Holy Trinity for example).  
This theological development not only marginalizes the Jewish faith and theological tradition, but also gives 
rise to Islam which arose in no small measure as a reaction and counterbalance to Christian interpretation of 
Biblical scripture and narrative, and in particular interpretation of the life and message of the prophet Jesus - 
and of course to fill a socio-political vacuum which is so often the case.  With this rise in Christianity's 
influence and predominance we see the waning of the Greco-Roman philosophical schools - Neo-Platonism, 
Stoicism and Epicureanism being the most far reaching and influential - after which we see a sharp decline in 
epistemological and social/ethical philosophy and a steep inclination toward scriptural dogma and moral and 
ethical platitudes and "law" as it were.  Enter the Dark Ages.

All religious systems, either from the East or the West, espoused morality and ethics as a core fundamental 
principle for the life of man.  Even the Greek philosophical schools had comprehensive system of ethics at 
their core.  The Western system taught that these morals and ethics should be followed for the attainment of 
heaven.  Eastern philosophy however, as well as arguably the teachings of Jesus specifically if they could be 
parsed from the Book within which they sat, looked at morality and ethics not as something to be followed 
for attainment of some desire or need, but as a representation of a higher and finer form of truth.  In 
Aristotle's terminology, it was in virtue, arête, that the greatest good could be achieved, and that ultimate 
happiness could be achieved, and that this virtue was a learned skill and could be cultivated by habit, just as 
any art form could. 
In its most pure form, as reflected in the basic tenets of Eastern philosophy however, and the fundamental 
principles that underlay morality or ethics in general, was that there was an interconnectedness to all things, 
all beings animate or inanimate, and leading a moral and ethical life allowed the individual to better 
comprehend and understand this interconnectedness, or at least abide by it and be in harmony with it.  In 
Patañjali's model, arguably the most systemic and well thought out of the systems of Yoga as they survive 
down to us in modern times which Vivekananda for no insignificant reason termed Royal Yoga, consistent 
with all religious systems in one way or another, sound morality and ethics were a core prerequisite on the 
path of ultimate liberation or illumination, or in Patañjali's terminology samādhi, a goal which can be reached 
only by the practice of sound morals and ethics.  In contrast to the Abrahamic religions which rested their 
moral and ethical code on the revelation of God as handed down by their respective prophets, to which its 
followers must abide or they be subject to eternal damnation in Hell, which were wrapped up in mandates of 
specific modes of worship, Yoga as it emerges as an offshoot of the philosophy of the Vedas, aka Hindu 
philosophy, in the first few centuries CE as reflected by Patañjali's Yoga Sūtras focus on what can be looked 
upon as a scientific method with respect to the production of liberation, irrespective and independent of the 
object of meditation, or God, that one chooses to believe in.
One of the age-old questions that at some level provided the foundations of philosophy itself, is what could 
be considered objective truth?  All of the philosophical systems of the world, despite their differences, all 
consider and try to answer in fact this single question.  In every encounter or situation in each person's life, 
there is continuity.  That is to say that throughout one's span of existence, there is always something that 
binds experience together.  Usually we call this something "I".  This was in essence the cogito ergo sum of 
Descartes, a Western interpretation if you will of age old Eastern philosophical notion of the mind.  But what 
is this "I" that lays at the foundation of our very existence.  We assume at every corner that we exist.  But 
have we really delved into the nature of this "I" that provides the framework for our lives?  Certainly, the 
philosophers throughout the ages had, and the mystics and shamans before them most certainly had, there 
was plenty of evidence for this.  But the everyday folk, the ones that ran the banks and the schools and were 
in Congress and ran countries, had they really?  Wasn't this one of the primary themes of Plato, and even the 
Muslim philosopher Al-Fârâbî of the 10th century, the importance of the role of the philosopher in society.  
Where had this notion gone?  Had it been lost somewhere or was it never really adopted outside of a 
theoretical construct of a philosopher or two throughout the ages? 
And therein lies one of, if not the, main distinction between the "Eastern" and the "Western" mode of 
thinking.  The Eastern philosophical systems believed taught that the search for the nature of "I" represented 
the ultimate task of life, whereas the western systems relied on objective proof, verifiable results from the 
interaction between hosts of objects, as the basis for life and reality.  It was this obsession with duality, the 
distinction between subject and object, although the cornerstone to scientific method and the means by 
which civilization has made so many significant advancements no doubt, had perhaps become an obstacle to 
the discovery of the very meaning of life itself.  The quest for the answer to that age-old question, as old as 
man itself: "Why are we here and from whence we came?" had been relegated to the world of religion, a 
marked deviation from Aristotle in fact, where the question of why - causation - was in fact the pillar upon 
which knowledge was built.
When we look at the Far Eastern tradition (i.e. Chinese philosophy) specifically through the lens of the Dàodé 
Jīng, Chuang-Tzu (Zhuangzi), the Confucian Analects and of course the Yìjīng, all of which are examined in this 
work, we find that contrary to the Western philosophical tradition, there were various versions of the texts 
that circulated, and more importantly, the texts themselves were less structured and organized than their 
Western counterparts.  By organized what is meant is that there was, (perhaps by design) less semantic and 
philosophical specificity baked into these works.  While their purpose was arguably the same as their Hellenic 
counterparts, their emphasis was not on logical coherence and rational consistency so much as the 
conveyance of anecdotes and stories that were intended to illustrate how to live a moral and ethical life, how 
best to govern, and the explanation of the fundamental relationship between Heaven, Earth and Man within 
the context of the given philosophical context.  With the case of the Analects and the Zhuangzi, perhaps the 
intent of the style of the work was to more closely capture the oratory style of the original teacher, by means 
of story and parable rather than dialectic or logic as a means for arriving at truth.  The language that was 
used by the ancient Chinese no doubt had an influence on this approach, given the open-ended nature of the 
Old Chinese writing system, but the early Daoist works especially are in some ways more similar to some of 
the Pre-Socratics and poets (Homer, Hesiod, Parmenides) than they are the philosophers in the Socratic 
lineage.
While differences in style and philosophical content between these classic Chinese philosophical works and 
their counterparts in the Western Hellenic tradition are clear, what is interesting to note is that the overall 
intent of the body of work is very much the same, the telos (purpose) as it were.  Both systems of thought 
were designed to express and capture how best to live, how best to govern, and the scope and boundaries of 
knowledge within this context.  This perhaps is the most interesting parallel that can be drawn when looking 
to the Far East in antiquity through a comparative Western lens - namely that as societies became more 
complex, as the struggles between nation states became more brutal, violent and barbaric, there arose a 
need of some sort of ethical and moral norms upon which the society as a while could be, should be, 
constructed.  What we find in early Chinese history, no different than the other traditions in antiquity 
throughout the world, is that philosophy and theology in antiquity are closely linked, one born from the other 
really, and ancient China is no different in this regard.  The notion that a supreme deity of the heavens 
establishes order and justice is a common theme throughout the ancient world in fact and parallels here can 
be drawn to the Ma'at of the Egyptians or the Ṛta  of the Indo-Aryans as well as of course the 
aforementioned association of divine legitimacy to the rulers themselves.  In this sense Shàngdì can be 
looked at as analogous to Marduk of the Sumer-Babylonians who rose to prominence as the head of the 
Babylonian pantheon as Babylon rose to power around the same timeframe much further to the West, or 
even Zeus/Jupiter in the Greco-Roman tradition a millennium or so later although the link to authority and 
power is not present.
Despite the diversity of Chinese philosophical traditions in antiquity given the broad geographic and cultural 
heritage which is so characteristic of the Far Eastern, i.e. ancient Chinese, civilization, there develops a 
common core set of theo-philosophical principles which emerge to form the basis of not just Daoist thought, 
but also the underlying metaphysical principles of Confucianism as well - the tradition that is adopted by the 
dynastic rulers toward the end of the first millennium BCE as the ancient texts, the Five Classics, become part 
of the common core curriculum of all state trained officials.  These principles are based primarily on their 
notion of Heaven, i.e. Tiān (天), from which their sense of not just universal order emanates but also their 
sense of socio-political and individual morality and ethics as well are based.  
Qì(气), or divine energy or breath, also emerges as one of the cornerstone principles of ancient Chinese, and 
ultimately provides the basis for the Daoist conception of universal animation to which direct parallels to the 
prāṇa, or cosmic breath of the Indo-Aryan and Upanishadic philosophical tradition can be drawn.  Jingzu (敬
祖), or the veneration of ancestors is altogether markedly unique characteristic of ancient Chinese 
philosophy, harkening no doubt to their pre-historic, Neolithic past to which they ultimately integrated into 
their philosophical tradition as it matured and evolved in the second half of the first millennium BCE.  And of 
course the basic principles of Yīn and Yáng (陰 陽), the basic cosmic universal polarity of opposing forces of 
female and male, receptive and creative, passive and active, dark and light forces that not only provide the 
cornerstone dualistic elements that underlie the very ancient divination process as reflected in the Classic of 
Changes, the Yìjīng, but also through which the basic cosmological and universal world view comes to be 
understood. 
What we have come to understand in contemporary academic circles as Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism 
all took root in ancient China, its pre-historic precepts incorporated and adopted into these theo-
philosophical traditions which was picked up by early Christians in China who drew a direct parallel between 
their God the Father and China's Shàngdì in Heaven.  This connection of Shàngdì to the legitimacy of the 
ruling emperor survived right up until the establishment of the Republic of China in the early 20th century CE, 
speaking to the broad influence of the deity as well as the lasting quality of the tradition to the Chinese.  
Similar pseudo-monotheistic traits can be found in Hinduism as well in sects such as Vaishnavism which 
worships Lord Viṣṇu as the one supreme godhead of the universe, or even the Brahmā of the Vedas which 
although a later Hindu development also takes on many of the attributes of a monotheistic deity.  For it is 
from Brahman which all things emanate or spring forth and it is from the inbreathing and outbreathing of 
Brahman that the universe is created (evolution), preserved, and destroyed (involution) according to the 
Upanishadic texts .  
For the most part however, the Hindu tradition is pantheistic and despite the different tendencies toward the 
worship of a single anthropomorphic deity, or even the worship of the somewhat asexual pseudo-
anthropomorphic principle such as Brahman, the Hindu tradition throughout its history always recognized 
and accepted the worship of many gods and in this it is distinct from the religious traditions that rose to 
prominence in the West and even unique in modern times in this respect.  These systems of belief that were 
prominent in the ancient Eastern civilizations for the most part prescribed to their followers the means of 
how to live in balance with your environment rather than who to worship to ensure a place in heaven, much 
more analogous to the ancient Greek theo-philosophical systems than the Abrahamic religious tradition.  
When we read Plato, Aristotle and even the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers in their native language (Greek 
and Latin) we are presented with a semantic and linguistic continuity and precision in terminology, what 
words are used when, that allows us to reconstruct their philosophical systems and points of view in a fairly 
complete way - at least complete relative to their Eastern counterparts.  
We also see a pronounced focus in these various schools which arose during Classical Greek antiquity of the 
role of reason (Logos), logic, semantics and language itself, as providing the foundation for dividing up the 
different aspects of reality into the intellectual categories that eventually came to be distinctive of the 
Western philosophical tradition.  From this initial bifurcation of natural philosophy and first philosophy by 
Aristotle, we see the fields of physics, metaphysics, mathematics, Astronomy, logic, and theology among 
others established deep in antiquity in the Western philosophical and subsequent academic tradition.  This 
categorization of thought in and of itself is one of the most influential, lasting and distinctive characteristics 
of "Western thought", an intellectual legacy of our Greek ancestors.  Plato and Aristotle, arguably the 
foundational philosophical teachers in the West, wrote and crafted works that dealt with specific topics, 
specific themes, from which their philosophical systems could be fairly well constructed and from which a 
semantic framework could be built by later followers in the tradition.  This allowed for later teachers and 
interpreters of their work to expound upon their original meanings, altogether allowing for metaphysical 
exposition in the various areas of the original works by expanding upon their original language and their 
original terminology.  It is from these building blocks that the modern scientific intellectual precipice in the 
West has been constructed.
One of the unique contributions of the Indo-Aryans however is the conservation and preservation of the 
specificities of a great deal of their ancient sacrificial rites, hymns and mythology in textual form, i.e. the 
Vedas.  The only corresponding set of texts and scripture that rivals it in terms of age is the Avesta of the 
Indo-Iranians (Persians) to the West, which although shares many similar linguistic and cultural themes that 
are found in the Vedic Sanskrit lore, does not have the same unbroken and longstanding continuing tradition 
of preservation and interpretation into the modern era as do the Vedas.  So with the Vedas then we have a 
direct window into the world of the Asian & European pre-history like no other literary tradition in fact.  This 
is what we term Eurasian philosophy, in terms of its age, its connection to the underlying mythos, and the 
continuation of themes and motifs that are atypical "Eurasian".
The Eastern philosophical tradition however remains unbroken with respect to its emphasis on basic, classical 
philosophical questions in tandem to its emphasis on faith and theology.  No doubt the Eastern tradition in 
antiquity had its pantheon of gods and goddesses which were formed out of the primordial chaos from which 
the universe emanates, its cosmogony - part of its Eurasian heritage - just as the Greco-Roman and Judeo-
Christian traditions espoused in fact, but the philosophical strain as it were was embedded deep in the 
Eastern traditions and was not subsumed by its anthropomorphic aspects and its scriptural tradition in and of 
itself.  In both Daoism and Hinduism, and of course with Buddhism, we see a much more philosophic flavor 
than the grand dictums of the Judeo-Christian traditions that cast such a long shadow, and eventually 
subsumed, the philosophic traditions of the Greco-Romans that had shaped the development of civilization 
for some one thousand years or so.  
We can see this distinct and enduring philosophical bent of the Indo-Aryan people, stemming no doubt from 
its Eurasian heritage which carried with it not only mythos, but logos as well, from some of the earliest 
passages we find about universal creation, cosmogony, from the Rigvéda in particular, which codifies stories, 
remnants and artifacts of the ritualistic, mythological and philosophical belief systems of the Indo-Aryan 
peoples from the second millennium BCE (1900-1200 BCE) which no doubt carries uniquely "Eurasian" 
characteristics and traits, features which we see throughout the mythos of Eurasia.  It is from this rich Vedic 
philosophical tradition in fact, with its mythos rooted in Eurasian antiquity, from which the Hindu religion 
eventually emerges, as well as Buddhism as its offshoot which also bears many similarities to its parent 
tradition as reflected in the Vedic philosophical tradition, from which its gets its very prototypical Eurasian 
philosophical traits and features.  And in these very early creation mythos, we find philosophical questions 
and openings that were preserved by the theological tradition of the East over millennia, the Eurasian logos 
as it were, which provided the metaphysical and theological basis for philosophy itself, as a function of the 
respective theogony and cosmogony rather than divergent from it, something again that we find lacking in 
the Western theological tradition in its mature form in Christianity and Islam most notably.
The Rigvéda is transcribed in Sanskrit verse, so there is a meter and a poetry to it that can only truly be 
appreciated when it is heard, typically when it is chanted as it is still done today.  These verses, the text, is 
believed to be divinely inspired and to have co-existed with creation itself, and thereby lies at the heart of 
not just Vedānta but Hinduism proper as well.  This belief in the co-existence of scripture with universal 
creation, or at least divine inspiration, is something that the Hindus share with their Judeo-Christian (and 
Islamic)  brethren to the West.  So what we see in the Vedic-Hindu creation mythos then, and what 
distinguishes the tradition as a whole from the Judeo-Christian tradition (again within which we place Islam) 
is a strong philosophical and analytical bent that goes back to the roots of the very scriptural tradition itself - 
this is what makes it so characteristically Eurasian in fact, its close connection not only with its Eurasian 
mythos heritage, but with its logos heritage as well.  This unbroken tradition, which starts with the pre-
historical Proto-Indo-Europeans, if not earlier, is then persisted in and reflected in what we find in the Vedas, 
one of the oldest extant pieces of literature known to man.
Vedic philosophy as reflected in the Vedas then, a child of Eurasian descent, passes through the Upanishadic 
phase which further codifies and elaborates on the philosophical and ritualistic tradition that we find in the 
Vedas, establishing a more sophisticated metaphysics and theology, setting the stage for further 
philosophical development and providing the foundations for Indian philosophy - again a direct descendent 
of its Eurasian grandparent in this case.  The tradition then moves through a more classic Western epic 
poetry phase, where this mythos from deep antiquity, that which was passed down from generation to 
generation from time immemorial through oral transmission, a specific linguistic technology from antiquity 
that that depended not just on language, but on verse - lyric poetry - in order to be preserved.  
This ancient mythos is integrated and synthesized into a corpus, a single narrative that starts from the very 
beginning of Time itself, and then, through various stages of evolution and transformation, the universe 
unfolds and mankind is created.  This is what we mean by a cosmogony, a universal ordering as it were, which 
is coupled in Eurasian antiquity more often than not by a theogony, where the gods themselves unfurl as it 
were from this chaotic watery abyss, this great cosmic egg that births this very universe itself as well as the 
pantheon of deities that are responsible for its preservation, who are responsible for its balance and 
harmony.  From these primordial deities, these mythic tales tell the deeds of these gods and heroes, the Ages 
of Man that were sung by the ancestors, a story of a Great Flood, rooted in this ancient mythos, where man is 
wiped from Earth, only to start once again, all colored in rousing verse which characterizes this aspect of the 
mythos to logos to theos progression as it were, a progression which we find across Eurasia that happens 
once civilizations become more advanced and writing proliferates to a point where this ancient mythos can 
be captured, where these lyric poems, these great epics, can get captured not by symbols, but by sounds 
which are encoded in symbols, the basic characteristics and features of the fairly advanced systems of writing 
that emerged in the first millennium BCE throughout Eurasia that provide the basis for all systems of writing 
that are used today in fact. 
But all these ancient theo-philosophical systems, regardless of their specific theogonic variants (their 
mythos), all share a common attribute that is inherent to their cosmogony itself, that is the notion of a cosmic 
and divine (and typically deified) ordering principle which was applied to the primordial chaos and/or watery 
abyss (via a cosmic egg or not) that existed prior to or is co-emergent with universal creation itself, which in 
turn effects balance and harmony within the heavens and throughout the cosmos, and then also -  in either 
deified form or via some abstract metaphysical principle - is then aligned with order, balance and harmony 
(and justice) in human affairs, providing the basis for not just morality and ethics for individual behavior 
(whatever the goal of life in that respect theo-philosophical system is presented as being), but also the moral 
and ethical foundations for society as whole as a collective.  Effectively we find an alignment of this cosmic 
ordering principle across all spheres of human life - human (mortal), divine (immortal), and cosmic.
This principle comes in two flavors really, as an abstract idea, metaphysical and cosmic and philosophical at 
the same time (as we see with the Hellenic and Chinese philosophical traditions for example), or in its more 
monotheistic archaic variant which is more heavily rooted in ancient mythos where the ordering principle is 
conveyed rather than spelled out via allegory - myth really.  The latter variant can be found for example in 
the Zoroastrian (Persian), Judeo-Christian, and Egyptian theo-philosophical systems where both cosmic and 
human order, again balance and harmony, are reflected in the and perennial battle between good and evil, 
deified as it were, which have direct counterparts in the psyche or mind, from which this notion of the Soul 
emerges which represents that which persists after death which is subject to judgment at death.  These 
Theo-philosophical systems come with judgment ceremonies, rights, rituals associated specifically with death 
to determine the fate of the Soul in the afterlife.  No matter what the respective manifestation of the idea is, 
again with the two primary variants that we find throughout Eurasia, they nonetheless rest upon the 
principle of order and justice which have a cosmic and a human element - the human mirroring the cosmic 
being a consistent theme throughout, man in the image of God as it were.  This is the Dao of the ancient 
Chinese, the Ṛta of the ancient Hindus (Indo-Aryans), the Aša of the ancient Persians (the Indo-Iranians), the 
Nómos/Zeus of the Hellenes, the Torah of the ancient Jews, Marduk of the Sumer-Babylonians and the Ma'at 
of the ancient Egyptians.  
The parallels here are not just eerie, not just strong, are certainly not coincidental or related to some sort of 
cultural diffusion, leaving really just two possible answers, the truth in all likelihood lying somewhere in the 
middle: 1) that all these ancient theo-philosophical systems throughout Eurasian antiquity all share a 
common ancestry, one that runs deeper than mythos (cosmos), and/or 2) that there is something 
fundamental to the human condition which maps the cosmos after the human mind, the latter being a 
rational entity with inherent ordering characteristics and traits that distinguish us from the rest of the species 
on the planet, therefore we apply the same qualities to our cosmos, to the divine, God being fashioned in the 
image of man as it were.  Regardless of how they got there, most certainly these features are pretty much 
fundamental to all of the philosophical systems that we see emerge in the so-called Axial Age throughout 
Eurasia.  We express this commonality using the Hellenic logos, although the term is being applied to a 
broader geographic context and is being pushed deeper into history, into pre-history and into the Neolithic, 
when a people who ended up spreading throughout all of Eurasia - or at least a set of ideas and principles 
related to this cosmic and material harmony, order and justice seeded all of Eurasian mythos - from which all 
of the major philosophical and theological systems we have inherited and persist into the modern era 
descend from essentially.  
This is our Eurasian philosophy, the second part of our Laurasian hypothesis which argues for the common, 
shared origins of not only the mythos of the major peoples of Eurasian antiquity but fundamental elements of 
the logos, i.e. philosophy, as well, from which is born the so-called Axial Age, within which not only are the 
mythos from antiquity captured, but the philosophical underpinnings from antiquity are captured as well, 
logos, the remnants of this Eurasian philosophical tradition which must have co-existed alongside the ancient 
mythos, captured and practiced and handed down through the sands of time by what we now call shamans, 
the priests of the Neolithic Era, who preserved and honed these ancient mystical arts out of which are born 
the first systems of philosophy - all of which share these skeptical and mystical features and traits for the 
most part, these very same features that we hear about that were in ancient Egypt, Greece, Persia and 
certainly on the Indian subcontinent as well as the Far East, China.  For Eurasian mysticism is the sibling of 
Eurasian philosophy, just as is Eurasian mythos - a body of knowledge that travelled alongside these ancient 
wanderers as they moved out of Africa some 60 to 70,000 years ago trying to survive, trying to find a home.  
The ancient human migration which populated the globe, from which humans - homo sapiens - established 
themselves as the most dominant species on the planet.   
For it was no doubt writing, and the advanced technology surrounding it that allowed for sounds themselves 
rather than just merely symbols to be portrayed and captured very specifically and nuanced as it were, 
allowing for the capture of ancient mythos and theos, and also as well - oft overlooked - the capture of this 
very ancient logos as well, one that came with those people as they left Africa but one which certainly 
continued to evolve over the ages into more local variants and flavors as it were, all the while - like man 
himself - adapting to its surroundings and terrain.  This new technology though, and of course the 
advancement of civilization that came along with it, was codependent and co-emergent with it, allowed the 
first philosophers all throughout Eurasia to not just write down what they had already inherited from their 
teachers, and their teachers' teachers, back through the sands of time - that which had been encoded, 
hidden really, within the ancient mythos itself, the most precious of wisdom to be passed on to only the most 
adept and faithful and prepared of students  - but to expand upon its foundations, using the new linguistic 
technology to create the first true systems of metaphysics and theology that the first philosophers are best 
known for, abandoning the old mythos, the ancient cosmogonies and theogonies not as useless, but as tools 
that can take a man, a people and a society, only so far, out of which emerges what we come to understand 
and appreciate as logos, the first rational reflection of the world as it were, the very hallmark of philosophy in 
the Axial Age all throughout Eurasia.
It is this process of evolution and transformation that we see taking place all throughout Eurasia in antiquity, 
reflected in each of the respective major traditions that have provided the foundations - both mythos and 
theos and logos - of all the major Religions as they stand today, and even Science itself, all of which emerged 
out of and from these ancient philosophical traditions that cropped up in the Mediterranean, the Near East, 
the Indian subcontinent and the Far East representing all of the major philosophical traditions from antiquity, 
each reflected throughout this Eurasia land mass that was the path of ancient man in his human migratory 
path that led to his dominion of the planet, planting the seeds of this so-called Axial Age, where we find these 
different traditions emerging and evolving, flourishing and advancing, moving beyond the ancient mythos 
and appealing to reason as the benchmark for truth, seeing the cosmos in mind as it were, existing in all these 
different variants and languages no doubt, all encoded with different systems of writing and different 
mythical narratives that had become socio-politically specific, but nonetheless all conserving and revealing as 
it were, their shared origins and past which despite all efforts at masking it and hiding it, can still nonetheless 
be found now that we, in the Quantum Era and the Information Age, the age of the genome and advanced 
computer systems technology, can put all the pieces together finally and see Eurasian philosophy for what it 
truly was.  Not so advanced as the philosophies that are the hallmark of the Axial Age no doubt, but more 
advanced than we give them credit for undoubtedly as well, and at the same time illustrating the sheer 
power and grace, and persistency and fortitude, of the spoken word and mythos itself, which when coupled 
with its mystical trappings which were preserved right alongside the mythos itself, kept and preserved this 
ancient wisdom throughout the ages, reaching further back into the mind of man than anyone would think 
possible.  If only one would dare.
And it is from this ancient mythos, coupled with this ancient logos which was intrinsically linked to theos, all 
harkening back to, and originating from and ultimately derived from, our ancient "Eurasian" ancestors, with 
each respective tradition and variant reflecting almost breadcrumbs on the journey of man, seeds as it were 
that all took root in local river valleys and basins which ended up blossoming into the philosophical traditions 
that span the globe today - from which we trace not only our theological heritage (Religion) in fact, but also 
from which our beloved Science owes its allegiance as well.  A heritage that reaches so far back in time, that 
it is forgotten that they all came from the same source - that mythos, logos and theos were all siblings as it 
were, and not descendants of each other as most would have us believe.  But the breadcrumbs were there, 
they still are, if anyone cared to look.  The clues are in the cosmogonies and theogonies no doubt, with so 
many shared features and parallels across such a geographic expanse, throughout Eurasia, but the clues are 
there in the first systems of philosophy as well, where our Dao from the Far East is essentially the same as 
Plato's Being, and the Vedic Brahman, each of which are rooted in their own mythos and their own language 
and history yes, but these ancient remnants from Eurasian philosophy, Proto-Indo-European philosophy as it 
were, the grandparent of all these systems throughout Eurasia in antiquity, nonetheless persevered even if 
they took different form and shape as they found permanent homes in all these ancient theo-philosophical 
traditions which emerge in the so-called Axial Age of man.

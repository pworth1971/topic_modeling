The terms mysticism and meditation are used throughout this work, in particular with respect the analysis 
and study, i.e. the "interpretation", of the life and teaching of a 19th century Bengali/Indian sage called 
Paramhamsa Ramakrishna, a topic of much of the last Part of this work.   As such, it is required that we do 
our best to define these terms, even though quite paradoxically the field of study, or domain, within which 
mysticism as a concept or idea originates, is quite clear that the term defies definition - by definition as it 
were.  Go figure.  But we are Westerners here, and we're certainly not Lǎozǐ or Heraclitus, and particularly 
given the intended audience of this work being Western academics at least to some degree, we must take 
the plunge and try to define the undefinable so if nothing else we round out the edges of what mysticism is 
not, at least from our perspective, and perhaps more importantly, try and place the terms within their proper 
intellectual, sociological and historical context.  In this way the reader can then at least come to a better 
understanding of how the author views these terms and how they are presented throughout the work, even 
if again they defy definition in the classical Western intellectual sense.
Mysticism, and the somewhat related practice of meditation, are terms that from a modern, scholarly and 
academic context are typically associated with longstanding, classically "Eastern", fields of inquiry.  They have 
nonetheless taken root in the West in the last century or so, mostly within the context of what the West 
refers to as Yoga, and through this relatively modern cultural transmission many of the terms, words, phrases 
and ideas associated with mysticism and meditation, have taken root in the languages of the West - English 
in particular of course.  These fields were not always "Eastern" however, and it is worthwhile to trace their 
roots and origins, back through history and time perhaps get a bit of insight not only into where this break 
between East and West occurred with respect to the mystical arts and practices themselves, of which 
meditation is of course one, but also come to a better understanding of the terms within the theological 
context within which they effectively "emerged", theology of course being a major theme in this work.   
Meditation is a much more technically specific term than mysticism, even though it can mean or imply 
"concentration", "deep thought", or simply "focus", within the context of the Eastern "mystical" tradition, 
the term has a fairly well defined history and context, as a translation of the Sanskrit word dhyāna, a word 
which plays a significant role in the fundamental practices, philosophy and metaphysics of the Indian theo-
philosophical tradition as a whole, to which the religions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism are 
fundamentally associated with.  In this context, meditation should be understood not in its most broad sense 
as the word is used in the West, but from a more technical standpoint as defined within the context of the 
ancient Indian theo-philosophical tradition, Yoga and Buddhism in particular.  And to be even more specific 
definitionally and contextually speaking, while the practice (the art really) of meditation is a fundamental 
aspect and core tenet of Buddhism , and perhaps is most often associated with it, the most precise 
definition actually comes from the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali, the foundational text of Yoga as we have come to 
know it in all its forms in the West today. 
Within the specifically Indian theo-philosophical tradition of Yoga, understood through the lens of the Yoga 
Sūtras, dhyāna - the Sanskrit corollary to the modern Western notion of meditation - is one of the "eight 
limbs", or practices, that are to be cultivated in order for "Yoga", samādhi really, to be attained.  Yoga in this 
context, definitionally is a state of mind, a state of being really, where the fluctuations of the mind are halted, 
or ceased, by means of deep concentration or absorption more or less.   Dhyāna, or "deep contemplation" 
(or again meditation), as the 7th limb of the system of Yoga is the next stage of maturation or development 
after dhāraṇā, the sixth limb of Patañjali's system.  Dhāraṇā signifies a state of mind that is somewhat less 
focused, or less intense, than dhyāna but is nonetheless a precursor to it.  While dhāraṇā is the holding of 
one's mind on a particular object of contemplation, a mantra or focus on one's breath or the focus on a 
particular deity for example, dhyāna is a more profound state of contemplation where the particular object 
of meditation is fixed within the mind as constant stream of thought - where the fluctuations or 
perturbations of the mind, even with respect to the object of contemplation or meditation itself, is "one 
pointed" and "uninterrupted".  The difference between dhāraṇā and dhyāna is more one of degree along the 
progression of Yoga as it is defined within the system itself, the end of which is the eighth limb which is a 
more commonly used, and nonetheless still not necessarily completely understood Sanskrit term called 
samādhi, the definition of which of course also hinges upon it's precursor limbs, or states of mind, of dhāraṇā 
and dhyāna.

Yoga in the modern era, and in particular in the West, comes in many forms and schools but all of them 
nonetheless rest upon this eight limbed system of Yoga as it is defined in the Yoga Sūtras themselves, a theo-
philosophical system which is classically "Indian", in the sense that it is the legacy of, and emerges directly 
out of, the intellectual, theological and metaphysical belief system which is ultimately tied to what we refer 
to throughout this work as the "Indo-Aryans", a people and culture who we know of and understand as 
reflected in the literary tradition to which it is directly tied to, i.e. the Vedas, one of the oldest extant body of 
literary work of known to man.   In the context of this work, we refer to the Indo-Aryans as the people and 
culture which is reflected in the Vedas, and a people who spoke Vedic Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas.   
The Indo-Aryans lived and thrived in the Indian subcontinent starting from around the 4th or 3rd millennium 
BCE or so.  The term Indo-Aryan then as we use it throughout, refers to a people and culture, and a related 
theo-philosophical belief system, that is co-existent with the Vedic corpus itself, i.e. the Vedas - a body of 
literature that is dated with respect to its so-called "composition" by most scholars (based primarily on 
linguistic evidence) to between 1500 BCE and 500 BCE depending upon the specific "layer" of material within 
the corpus itself. 
However, while the dating of the so-called "composition" of the Vedas (as well as the "philosophical" portion 
of the Vedas which is referred to as the Upanishads, the earliest of which are believed to have been added to 
the Vedic corpus in the middle to late part of the first millennium BCE) is not disputed by the author, we do 
however argue that the oldest portion of the Vedas (for example the Rigvéda) reflects a set of beliefs, rituals 
and mythology that reach much further back into ancient history than most scholars consider.  The argument 
for this rests primarily on not only the "form" or "structure" of the Vedas (lyric poetry primarily, what is 
usually referred to as "hymns") which points unequivocally to the oral transmission of said hymns for 
generations, if not centuries, prior to their actual "composition", but also the typically underemphasized and 
sometimes even overlooked nature, breadth and power of the oral transmission itself in antiquity - what the 
author considers to be a "technological innovation" of sorts that is one of, if not the, unique attribute of 
homo sapiens that distinguishes it from the rest of the species on the planet and in turn is perhaps (as a 
corollary to the actual invention of language itself) the very reason why mankind has become the most 
widespread, successful and dominant species on the planet.
For we know in fact that man, in its modern physiological form as homo sapiens, existed for tens of 
thousands of years in complex hunter-gatherer societies throughout Eurasia (and of course in Africa as well 
which we know from genetic evidence is where our ancestors in Eurasia came from) prior to the invention of 
writing and even prior to the advent of "advanced societies", what is commonly referred to in the academic 
and historical literature in the West as the so-called "advent of civilization".  Furthermore it is also clear that 
in order to survive, these ancient humans had to work together and collaborate with each other, i.e. 
communicate, to not only facilitate the tracking, hunting and killing of large game upon which their survival 
depended, but also learn to inhabit and survive in a wide range of harsh habitats and environments across 
Eurasia - for which (archeological) evidence exists that shows that they did quite successfully for some 
30,000 years or so give or take before these more "advanced" societies developed, and before agriculture 
was invented which facilitated the development of more advanced, stable societies which are the hallmark of 
the so-called "Neolithic Revolution".  It is also clear that in order to facilitate these technological and 
sociological innovations, "language", as defined by the ability communicate complex ideas and thoughts 
between individuals which of course depended upon at least some level the capability for abstract thought, 
was absolutely essential.  And in turn, from the author's perspective primarily again, along with these 
advanced intellectual and linguistic capabilities, there also developed and evolved in parallel a means, a 
method, by which these ideas - these technological and intellectual innovations as it were - could be 
effectively "transmitted" across generations such that the overall body of knowledge of homo sapiens could 
increase, exponentially really, to support and facilitate the proliferation of the species itself.  In other words, 
in the author's view, oral transmission techniques in and of themselves, techniques which we find 
throughout virtually all of the ancient texts across Eurasia, can be viewed as a specific intellectual (and 
technological) innovation as it were and as such reflected a form of natural selection from a Darwinian 
standpoint.
Furthermore, it is not too much of an intellectual leap to consider that this body of knowledge that was 
transmitted from generation to generation in antiquity, which again also included the method, the means, by 
which this transmission could take place in as invariant a form as possible, included not only knowledge of 
technology proper - how to make tools, how to build shelter, how to hunt and track game, etc. -  but also 
cultural phenomena as well, "belief systems", such that not just species survival could be supported and 
preserved but that cultural, or tribal knowledge, could also be passed down and preserved as well.   This 
ability to transmit knowledge from generation to generation such that the overall body of knowledge of a 
people, culture or society would exponentially expand over time, greatly enhancing the probability of survival 
and persistence of not just homo sapiens itself as a species, but also of the specific permutations of said 
species, i.e. specific cultures and peoples.  This technique of oral transmission then, is arguably a critically 
important trait, mechanism as it were, to support the flourishing or "thriving" of peoples and cultures in 
antiquity.  In fact, we go one step further and argue that this technique of knowledge transmission, i.e. oral 
transmission techniques in and of themselves, combined of course with the invention of language itself which 
predates the techniques of transmission, represents the defining characteristic of homo sapiens, i.e. thinking 
man, in its later stages of development and is the specific technological, and fundamentally intellectual 
(sapiens, i.e. "thinking") innovation which drives the advancement of proliferation of the species which 
underpin the Neolithic Revolution.  These linguistic techniques in toto then, as we see reflected in the earliest 
literary treatises extant from antiquity across Eurasia more broadly, and in India more specifically in the 
Vedas, were the specific innovation that underpinned not only the species ability to out-compete, out-survive 
and eventually effectively take over dominion of the planet, but also underpinned the persistence, the 
survival, of cultures and nation states which we see take root in Eurasia in the 2nd and 1st millennium BCE as 
well.   
The point we are making here is that in order for this to occur, in order for knowledge transmission to 
effectively take place, and in order for the scope of knowledge to continue to increase with each successive 
generation, there must have been technology, a means, by which this transmission could occur and be 
facilitated.  And this very technology is what we find in the very first written records that show up in 
archeological and literary records once writing is developed and once the necessary tools to support writing 
on a wide scale are developed as well.  In other words, shortly after the invention of language that supported 
the evolution of ancient hominids into homo sapiens, our ancestors, it is the author's contention that the 
means to transmit this knowledge developed as well, the combination of which provided much of the 
distinguishing characteristics of these ancient peoples, ancient man, that supported their natural selection as 
it were as the dominant species of hominid on the planet, and throughout Eurasia in particular which is the 
primary geographic region of focus in antiquity of this work.   This particular technological innovation, again 
one which we see in the earliest literary records across Eurasia as well as in ancient Egypt in fact, is what is 
referred to in the literature as the oral tradition, or oral transmission techniques - techniques and methods 
that we find evidence for not just in the first written records that crop up in the 3rd and 2nd millennium BCE 
across Eurasia, but in fact techniques which appear to be co-existent with ancient (and modern) hunter-
gatherer societies themselves which exist without the support of, or need for, writing.  We find various oral 
transmission techniques employed for example by the Native Americans for example, by the native remote 
tribes that still exist in pockets in South America, by the Aborigines in Australia, even in pockets of remote 
areas in highly populated and relatively modern countries like India and China for example, in the remote 
regions of Tibet and Nepal - all of these people and societies have very rich and persistent oral traditions that 
go back generations, well beyond what many more modern, technologically advanced and writing dependent 
societies and peoples are capable of imagining, for the very reason that modern humans, those that have 
grown up with the support of writing and books, no longer have the need for, nor the capability, to memorize 
or remember bodies of knowledge like people in antiquity did prior to the invention, or widespread use, of 
writing.  
It is not too far-fetched to imagine, and in fact we have modern day examples of this very fact, that the oral 
transmission of ideas, can persist in an essentially consistent form, for hundreds if not thousands of years.  
Mankind's survival in antiquity arguably depended upon this very capability, and therefore, necessity being 
the mother of invention as it were, there developed very specific techniques, intellectual "technologies", to 
support this capability.  It is these techniques in fact that we find in virtually all pre-historical peoples and 
societies, Eurasia being no exception, in order to support the transmission of the very particular and unique 
sociological, historical and theo-philosophical traditions of the respective peoples and cultures in question.  
Techniques, intellectual "technologies", that again were "invented" or "devised" for the relatively invariant 
transmission of ideas across generations - the invariant transmission of sounds, ceremonies and forms of 
worship in fact, i.e. what we refer to herein as theo-philosophical knowledge.  The specific tools that were 
used were lyrical, in the sense that specific verse and rhyming techniques, effectively mnemonic devices, 
were employed to facilitate memorization and transmission, along with of course the use of mythical 
narratives as well, i.e. mythology - all of which made things easier to remember, understand and pass down 
from generation to generation.
And this is precisely what we find all throughout the very first texts that show up in the archeological record 
after the invention of writing, where scholars, priests or poets, or scribes - a sociological designation which is 
an outgrowth of what are referred to sometimes as shamans - transcribed or wrote down, i.e. "compiled", as 
the documentation of the very ancient lore that had supported that specific people or society for generations 
over a time period of centuries and millennia even.  This is what we find inherent in the "form" of the Far 
Eastern texts of the Dàodé Jīng, and the Yìjīng (although the Yìjīng is not lyrical per se but more 
mathematically and logically structured), as well as the ancient Chinese poems such as the Heavenly 
Questions, in the major epics of the Hellenes such as the Iliad and the Odyssey and the Theogony of Hesiod 
which were transcribed in hexameter, or lyric, verse, in the great Sumer-Babylonian epic the Enûma Eliš, in 
the Pyramid Texts and the so-called Book of the Dead of the ancient Egyptians, as well as in the earliest 
written records of the Indo-Aryans and the Indo-Iranians as well, that is in the Vedas and the Avesta 
respectively.  
Scholars of ancient Studies typically consider that the "content" of these ancient texts could only be a few 
hundred, or at most a thousand years older than the date when they were "transcribed", or "written down", 
but it is the author's contention that is altogether possible, and in fact probable, that the content of these 
ancient texts, and probably much of the underlying rhythmic and linguistic structure along with the mythical 
narratives themselves, persisted for thousands of years prior to them being written down.  And in turn that 
the technology and capabilities which underpinned the oral transmission tradition which had supported 
mankind's development during the Upper Paleolithic and into the Neolithic Era (a period of some 20 to 30 
thousand years) dissolved for the most part once it no longer became necessary.  In other words, once these 
ancient theo-philosophical traditions were written down, compiled as it were, the specific technological 
innovation which had supported the transmission of these idea, the intellectual capabilities that underpinned 
oral transmission as a "tool" or "technology", disappeared along with it.
As such, it is the author's contention (which although is shared to a certain extent by some ancient historians 
and scholars, none of them seem to allow for the oral transmission techniques to reach as far back in history 
as the author theorizes and concludes based upon the analysis and research in Parts I and II of this work) that 
the dates of the "content" of some of the oldest extant literature we find throughout Eurasia, the Vedas 
being the prime example, should be moved even further back in history than what most ancient historians 
and scholars attribute them to - a method of dating that relies on a much more "literal" and "factually 
scientific" dating technique that dates the specific texts relative to their associated archeological or linguistic 
context rather than their theo-philosophical "content".  This perspective on the dating of the "content" of 
this material which shows up in the archeological record once writing is invented, provides for an altogether 
different perspective entirely not just on the possible "dating" of the material itself, but (as we argue 
throughout this work and especially in Parts I and II) also supports the hypothesis of the potential shared 
origins of much of the theo-philosophical "content" that we find in antiquity - in Eurasian antiquity 
specifically which is the geographic nexus of this work.  In this context, we can refer to and discuss a 
"Eurasian" theo-philosophical tradition that is "reflected" in the earliest extant texts that we have from all of 
these ancient peoples and civilizations within which we find many common themes, motifs and narratives.
The argument then, is that the "content" of the earliest extant literature from antiquity throughout Eurasia, 
Vedas included, are much earlier - millennia perhaps - than most, if not all, ancient historians typically date 
the source material to.  Once this is established, or at least granted as a potentially conceivable hypothesis, 
one can then begin to discuss the possibility  of a shared common (intellectual) ancestry of this material, i.e. 
the ideological content as it were, of the earliest extant literature we find from ancient history throughout 
Eurasia.  This thesis again is based primarily on the known and well documented ability of people to transmit 
language in lyric poetry,  form for hundreds if not thousands of years with very little variance, as well as the 
commonalities linguistically and theo-philosophically that we find in the earliest extant literature from all of 
these ancient peoples of Eurasia which are studied within the context of this work - specifically the Hellenes 
(the Greeks), the Indo-Aryans, the Indo-Iranians, the Sumer-Babylonians, and the ancient Chinese which are 
all explored at length in Parts I and II of this work.
Regardless of the strength of the arguments made here, in a time period that lacks much if any intellectual 
records in fact, what is certain however, is that the transmission of knowledge in antiquity, prior to the 
development of writing, was done in oral form and was facilitated by the use of lyric and or hymnic poetry.  A 
specific linguistic technique which shows up in literary form in virtually all of the earliest extant literary 
treatises from the various cultures and peoples throughout Eurasia in antiquity (2nd and 1st millennium BCE 
primarily), a linguistic technique that facilitated, and was specifically designed for, consistent and persistent, 
i.e. invariant, oral transmission of ideas.  We argue then that a case can be made, albeit circumstantial, that 
these techniques which facilitated and supported the transmission of ideas, in mythological and theological 
form mostly, for millennium prior to the invention and proliferation of writing, is in all likelihood the very 
reason, the necessary condition as it were, that mankind developed the capability of "advanced civilization" 
itself.
This period in ancient history has come to be known as the Neolithic Revolution and is characterized by the 
widespread use and adoption of agriculture and the domestication of animals, which in turn led to the 
establishment of trade and commerce, which in turn led to the invention of writing itself along with the tools 
and techniques that were necessary to support writing.  All of which in the aggregate come to characterize 
what we effectively call "civilization" from an ancient historical perspective, even though it is altogether very 
likely, and in fact very probable, that long before the invention of writing - and long before the invention of 
agriculture of the domestication of animals - human beings, i.e. homo sapiens, were communicating and 
passing down complex ideas via the use of these linguistic techniques, intellectual technologies in a sense, in 
order to support, and in turn ensure, the survival of their "people" - from a socio-political perspective, as well 
as from (the very much related) theo-philosophical perspective as well.  The latter being a main topic of Parts 
I and II of this work.

Mysticism then, within the context this work, is distinct from the modern, 20th century usage of the term 
which was created primarily to distinguish "Eastern" spiritual practices (that underpin again Yoga and 
Buddhism primarily, and ancient shamanic practices more generally ) from the study of Western theology, 
e.g. Comparative Religious studies, which is much more dogmatic and "scripturally" based.  We use the term 
as a distinguishing characteristic of ancient theo-philosophy in general, a tradition that is reflected and 
preserved by means of language and forms of writing yes, but also by oral transmission techniques, as well 
again lyric poetry, primarily.  It is these common themes and characteristics of virtually all of the ancient the-
philosophical texts from antiquity that we find in the very earliest literary texts throughout all of Eurasia and 
the Mediterranean which all to some extent contain "mystical" undertones and themes - mystical in this 
sense denoting an experiential oneness and connection with the ground of being and universal existence 
itself, and one which only later, as ancient civilizations evolve and progress, becomes transplanted with - 
albeit in allegorical and mythological form - deities and their respective worship via means of specific rituals 
and incantations, i.e. hymns.  
This later theo-philosophical development in antiquity, which is born out of its mystical roots as it were, is 
characterized initially by ancestor worship, and then in turn by ceremonial worship, which in turn evolves 
into cultural specific mythology and the worship of "divine" figures who are depicted as heroes and 
associated with various aspects of the natural world - like the mother goddess who is worshipped to support 
fertility for example.  So even though mysticism then as a modern designation of these very ancient "belief 
systems", along with their underlying practices, or arts, as exemplified by the Indo-Aryan art of meditation as 
it were, is a necessary designation to distinguish these types of belief systems and practices from Western 
theology, i.e. Religion in the most orthodox sense, within the context of the modern Western intellectual and 
academic, or scholarly, landscape, from the point of view of the ancient peoples themselves from whom 
these practices and techniques that we call mystical originate from, had no such designation as the 
worldview of these ancient peoples was fundamental mystical at the core.  That is to say fully unified and 
experiential, passing even beyond the boundaries of death, and integral to life, and reality, itself - a 
fundamental and all-pervading characteristic of human experience, of existence in all its forms, and as such 
did not need definition per se.
Mysticism, from this specifically ancient theo-philosophical perspective, is virtually ubiquitous in the mode of 
worship and underlying belief system of all the cultures and peoples through Eurasia in antiquity which we 
see reflected and crystalized particularly in the earliest theo-philosophical treatises of the various peoples 
and cultures which inhabited this geographic region during this time period in ancient history (Eurasia during 
the 3rd, 2nd and 1st millennium BCE).  If we then take the next logical step to search for the roots of this 
mysticism, we find that it can be traced - ideologically and linguistically - not just across the Indo-European 
linguistic and cultural landscape (the Proto-Indo-Europeans), but also even to Afro-Asiatic speaking peoples 
as well (in Northern Africa), begging the question of how far back in time these theo-philosophical tenets and 
principles upon which our definition of mysticism is based, could have potentially originated.  This logical 
progression of the tracing of these ideas as far back as the 4th and even 5th millennium BCE, provides much of 
the basis for the argument of the shared origins of what we refer to throughout this work as "theo-
philosophy", common themes and literary techniques that are to be found throughout Eurasia in antiquity - 
despite the linguistic peculiarities and specificities of individual cultures, peoples and of course the ancient 
theo-philosophical works themselves (which surround the very first literary compositions which show up in 
the archeological record once writing is invented and is spread throughout its respective societies in its 
respective form - be it hieroglyphic, cuneiform, ancient Chinese, Sanskrit or Greek depending upon the 
culture and geographic region and people in question),  which make them "appear" different from a theo-
philosophical standpoint but at closer look can be seen as reflecting very similar ideas and concepts - theo-
philosophically speaking at least.  
It is upon this basis that we speak of and use the term mysticism to reflect the very ancient and longstanding 
theo-philosophical belief systems which underpin all of these ancient theo-philosophical works from 
antiquity across all of the cultures and peoples throughout Eurasia and Northern Africa really, and in turn the 
surrounding mythology (mythos) that is characteristic of ancient man in general.  The cultural specific mythos 
traditions having evolved of course from their theo-philosophical precedents, ideologically at least, which 
presumes that the "spirit world" (which consists of the realm of the dead along with the realm of the "gods" 
as well) was not just "real" but that this aspect of reality actually governed, or presided over, the physical and 
natural world that ancient man depended upon for survival.  It is this belief system of the role of the spirit 
world over the physical or natural world, that in fact underpins all of the ancient forms of ceremonial 
worship, and in turn provides the theological, and socio-political really, basis for virtually all of the nation-
states that emerge in the ancient world as "civilization" takes root, and as more complex and advanced 
societies, which are the hallmark of the Neolithic Revolution in fact, emerge - where virtually all of the kings, 
emperors and pharaohs of these ancient nation-states all claimed descent from, or alignment with, these 
ancient gods or heroes in one respect or another.

As reluctant as the author is to feign to have enough knowledge regarding the nature of the mystical 
experience, or Indian culture and mythology as a whole for that matter, to shed any further light on 
Ramakrishna  as an historical and religious figure than has already been put forth by countless other learned 
scholars of Comparative Religion and Indian philosophy in the last century, most of whom are arguably much 
more experienced in the ways of mysticism and/or Indian philosophy than the author and are much more 
familiar with the language of the majority of the source material on the subject, i.e. Bengali and Sanskrit for 
the most part, the fact remains that Ramakrishna is not just an enigmatic and exemplary figure worth 
revisiting within the context of this work as whole and many of the underlying premises and theses of the 
work itself, but at a very fundamental level he represents the most well studied and documented mystic who 
represents perhaps the prime example in the modern era of the rationale or an expansion of the definition of 
"knowledge" within the Western intellectual system as a whole to include "mystical" experiences, one of the 
major themes and arguments of this work as a whole.  
This debate surrounding the so-called "Interpretation" of Ramakrishna as a mystic and religious practitioner, 
and ultimately the perspective on him as a potential "divine incarnation", or "avatar", as it were as defined 
within the context of the Hindu religious tradition within which he emerges and represents an essential and 
integral part of, both theologically and socio-culturally speaking of course, effectively begins and is sparked 
by the publishing of a fairly controversial academic work called Kālī's Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the 
Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna authored by Dr. Kripal and first published in 1995.  It is this work that has 
in no small measure been the source of very vigorous and ongoing debate regarding how to "interpret" 
Ramakrishna as a religious and historical figure that has evoked, not surprisingly given the underlying theses 
therein and general tone of the work itself along with many of his self-termed "scandalous" accusations 
regarding not just Ramakrishna himself, but also the literary tradition that surrounds him which is effectively 
sourced from the Ramakrishna Order which Vivekananda himself founded.

A note on the background of Dr. Kripal who is arguably the center of this discussion, whose theoretical 
framework and analytical techniques with regards to the subject at hand have been highly criticized, a 
tradition in and of itself to which the present author has contributed and within the context of this work of 
course, continues to a large extent.  According to publicly available knowledge regarding Dr. Kripal, he was 
born in 1962 and received his Ph. D. from the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1993, with his thesis 
being on, and representing the origins and source of, the very same material and subject which eventually 
made its way into the form of contents that were published initially in 1995 that carry the title, which in and 
of itself clearly is designed to evoke a strong reaction, Kālī's Child: The Mystical and Erotic in the Life and 
Teachings of Ramakrishna.  
Dr. Kripal is by all measures a very well respected academic and scholar in particular within Comparative 
Religious citadel of science circles and clearly has a deep background in Comparative Religion, Indian 
philosophy, Eastern mysticism and Western esotericism, and more recently it would appear, based upon 
some of his more recent publications, the Paranormal.  Despite his familiarity and mastery of these subjects, 
at least from an academic and scholarly perspective, he nonetheless rests squarely within the Western 
intellectual and academic tradition itself, i.e. what the author somewhat affectionately refers to as 
(borrowing Pirsig's terminology) the citadel of science.  Dr. Kripal also clearly, and not surprisingly given his 
deep research and analysis of Ramakrishna, also has a strong grasp and intellectual background on Hindu and 
Indian philosophy in general, albeit - as judged from the contents of Kālī's Child specifically, the work which 
represents the definitive "outsiders" perspective on the subject at hand.  
Furthermore, and to his credit, Dr. Kripal also has taken the time to learn and read Bengali in its original 
source script, which is no small accomplishment in and of itself (the present author in question has no such 
skill or expertise for example and as such has to rely on the English translations of much of the source 
material that sits at the heart of the debate in question, material which Dr. Kripal suggest of course which 
does not accurately reflect or cover the "hidden secret" which arguably rests at the very heart of his 
arguments and in no small measure represents the source of the heated controversy surrounding his work.  It 
is from his knowledge of Bengali in fact, which he leverages to translate for himself much of the original 
source material regarding the subject at hand, which he uses to formulate the crux of his argument as it 
were, and provides the basis for much of the most controversial, and also in turn the most heavily disputed 
and criticized, assertions and arguments which underpin Kālī's Child - to use his language, what he refers to 
as, the "hidden secrets" that are of a "scandalous" and "sexually erotic" nature that the insider tradition (a 
term he does not use mind you) has not just closely guarded but has consciously whitewashed and removed 
from the English translations of said Bengali works (an accusation which he subsequently relaxes to a large 
extent after his initial publication of Kālī's Child in fact) which he has "recovered" from a thorough analysis 
and review of some of the main Bengali source texts themselves.  
These source texts are for the most part first-hand accounts regarding the life and teaching of Ramakrishna 
that have the benefit of being written in the same language that Ramakrishna spoke and therefore represent 
to a certain degree a more "accurate" or "direct" line of sight into the events surrounding Ramakrishna's life 
and teachings that are described therein, and furthermore has the potential at least to provide a more clear 
and "accurate" window into the subject at hand, as well as arguably has the benefit of reflecting more 
directly the precise language and terminology that presumably Ramakrishna himself used.  All of which 
presume of course that the specific socio-cultural and theo-philosophical context of 19th century Bengal and 
Indian theo-philosophy in general are properly understood and taken into account when interpreting the 
meaning of, and providing accurate translations of, the underlying said Bengali source material, an 
assumption that in fact is called into serious question not only by this author, but also by the "insider" 
tradition as a whole.   It is these assertions, and especially given the nature and extent, and potent and 
sexually charged language of said assertions, as well as the related translations and translation techniques in 
general that Dr. Kripal employs, along with the his overall knowledge and background of the underlying socio-
cultural and theo-philosophical milieu within which Ramakrishna's spiritual life is played out which is the very 
subject of the source materials in question, that represent the primary elements of criticism in the "insider" 
tradition's response to Kālī's Child, to which this author of course piles on to a large extent.    
Kālī's Child however was met with a wide range of fairly extensive and severe criticism by a fairly broad base 
of scholars, who for the sake of simplicity purposes, we will categorize as representative of the "insider" 
perspective of the debate in question which is discussed herein at length, a delineation and terminology that 
is consistent with the description of the debate that is put forth by arguably the most influential and 
extensive work that represents the "insiders' perspective, a work entitled Interpreting Ramakrishna, Kālī's 
Child Revisited.   Insiders in this context refer to those who are members of, or are affiliated or associated 
with in any way, the theo-philosophical tradition and heritage of Ramakrishna, primarily as established and 
interpreted in the recasting of Vedānta and Yoga in the West by Swami Vivekananda, a direct disciple of and 
the spiritual successor of Ramakrishna himself.
These so-called "insiders" are juxtaposed with "outsiders", i.e. those who are not beholden to or have been 
immersed in the teachings of the life and times of Ramakrishna and his disciples by those who are directly 
responsible for bringing such message and teachings to the West, namely the Ramakrishna Order.  Kālī's Child 
of course, for better or worse (mostly for worse within the context of this work unfortunately) is the poster 
child for this perspective, and such is in the unfortunate position of having to bear the brunt of this author's 
criticism.  These "outsiders", generally speaking, almost all hail from the Western intellectual and academic 
tradition, again from within the confines of the citadel of science, and have rightfully praised the work for its 
originality and courage and heralded it as a seminal work in Comparative Religious studies as a whole no 
doubt reflecting the (albeit ultimately fundamentally flawed from the author's as well as insiders 
perspective), attempt at of the analysis of a modern Eastern "mystic" from a classically Western 
psychoanalytical perspective.  
For the purposes of full disclosure, while one could argue that the author represents the "insiders" 
perspective for the most part, having been schooled and trained in the art of Yoga and Vedānta by and within 
the tradition itself as inspired by Ramakrishna and as institutionalized and systemized and brought to the 
West within the context of the Ramakrishna Order by Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna's direct spiritual 
successor.   The author however does at the same time benefit from not falling neatly into either the 
"insider" or "outsider" camp as he is not directly affiliated with or dependent upon the Ramakrishna Order in 
any way (despite his clear apologetic leanings thereof which he is very open about), nor is he wedded to or 
beholden to the academic community in any way either, the so-called citadel of science to borrow a term 
from Robert Pirsig, as Dr. Kripal clearly represents and in many respects is beholden to, and quite literally 
depends upon for his livelihood, a perspective that should be kept in mind at all times when his views are 
presented (as accurately and objectively as possible despite the author's leanings) as they are reflected in 
Kālī's Child, a work which no matter how much it is criticized nonetheless represents a definitive landmark in 
the history of the interpretation of Ramakrishna specifically, but also within the Comparative Religious 
academic and scholarly tradition itself no doubt, regardless of whether or not one agrees with its conclusions 
or assertions.  
First an analysis of the source material that is used and relied upon in Kālī's Child evidence for the account 
and interpretation of the intense sādhana phase of Ramakrishna's life as being more "true" and "factual" 
than the so-called standard interpretation of said events as has been inherited in the West by a variety of 
English translations of biographies of Ramakrishna.  Three sources in particular are the most heavily cited by 
Dr. Kripal, and each is leveraged quite extensively, in both the source language Bengali as well as in English 
translation in fact depending upon the context, and in toto, depending upon Dr. Kripal's interpretation and 
value and context that he attributes to said source text, are used to establish the basis for his thesis - namely 
that Ramakrishna's sādhana, or practices of spiritual disciplines, are first and foremost best characterized as 
Tantric and as such lend themselves to be subject to Freudian psychoanalysis to a large extent, especially 
given the sexual and erotic associations that are attached to the Tantric tradition as a whole from a Western 
academic and scholarly perspective.  
It is once this basic premise is established in Kālī's Child, again that Ramakrishna's spiritual practices and 
overall psych-analytical frame of mind is best characterized and viewed through a Tantric lens, that allows 
him to safely apply a Freudian psychoanalytical treatment of Ramakrishna's "psyche" through which he is 
then able to deduce or infer potential sources and/or driving and motivating forces, again from a 
psychological perspective, that allow him to shed what he believes to be, or describes as new and previously 
unrevealed and even revelational insights into Ramakrishna as a psychological and erotic being as it were.  It 
is from this intellectual foundation and line of argument, which starts with the characterization of 
Ramakrishna as a fundamentally Tantric spiritual aspirant and therefore neatly aligns and can be understood 
in a classical Freudian psychoanalytical framework, that provides the intellectual and rational foundations of 
his basic underlying and overarching thesis which underpins the entire work itself - namely that 
Ramakrishna's states of mind, or experiences, which are so well documented in the literature surrounding 
the sādhana phase of Ramakrishna's life, can be categorized or understood as the direct result of "secret" 
and previously unrevealed traumatic sexual encounters or experiences as well as repressed homoerotic 
sexual desires which have been left out of the English literary tradition surrounding Ramakrishna.
The first of these biographies is the first one that was actually published and was authored by Ram Chandra 
Datta, one of Ramakrishna's so-called "householder" devotees who no doubt was part of Ramakrishna's 
inner circle toward the end of Ramakrishna's life.   It should be pointed out that according to tradition, it is 
said that Ramakrishna asked Ram Chandra Datta to wait to publish his book until after his death for if it were 
published before Ramakrishna is said to have told him that it would hasten his death, as it is well known that 
Ramakrishna stated that his passing would be a direct result of, and follow shortly thereafter, when he 
became widely known heralded within the Bengal and Calcutta community as a so-called "incarnation" of 
God, i.e. when the secret was out so to speak.  This biography represents the primary source of much of Kālī's 
Child "scandalous" and altogether "left-handed" Tantric, and ultimately Freudian, perspective on 
Ramakrishna's life and teachings, the verity of which he looks to defend, or challenge as the case may be, 
relative to the two other primary, first-hand accounts regarding the life and teachings of Ramakrishna, the 
two of which arguably represent the most widely read and influential works in the West at least, through 
English translation of course, a translational exercise that is used as one of the arguments in Kālī's Child as 
one of the primary justifications as to why the "secrets" that he reveals in his work, i.e. are "recovered" from 
the original Bengali source material, had not been exposed or written about in the West until Kālī's Child was 
first published in 1995. 
The second biography of Ramakrishna that is relied upon heavily in , and arguably which he turns to and 
quotes the most from, was also written in Bengali and was also written by another of Ramakrishna's 
householder devotes, the famed Mahendranath Gupta.  The work's title in Bengali is Śrī-Śrī-Rāmakṛṣṇa-
Kathāmṛta, which translates into English as The Nectar of Srī Ramakrishna's Words and in the English 
translation which was written by Swami Nikhilananda is entitled the Gospel of Srī Ramakrishna.  The English 
text was initially published in 1942 and includes a lengthy Introduction which summarizes Ramakrishna's life 
and teachings and includes a lengthy summary and description of his spiritual practices as well.  The Gospel of 
Srī Ramakrishna is arguably the most widely read of all of the works on Ramakrishna and was very influential 
in bringing his message and teachings to the West. 
Mahendranath Gupta is known within the tradition simply as "M", as this is how he refers to himself in the 
work itself, much of which is narrated in dialogue form, not unlike the form of Plato's dialogues in fact, 
except that M provides much background material along with the narrative of the dialogues themselves, 
many of which include conversations between and among many of Ramakrishna's disciples.  Mahendranath 
Gupta was a well-respected scholar and academic within the Calcutta intellectual community who worked as 
a teacher and administrator for the majority of his professional life and who spent a good deal of time, as is 
documented in his work, directly with Ramakrishna in many intimate and personal settings in the last few 
years of Ramakrishna's life. 
According to tradition, the voluminous and detailed account written by Mahendranath Gupta was sourced 
from not only very detailed notes that he took during the time he spent with Ramakrishna, but also from his 
renowned, almost photographic, memory and covers much of the details and happenings of last few years of 
Ramakrishna's life - basically from the early 1880s until Ramakrishna's passing in 1886.  Notably the time 
period described in this work comes after the period of Ramakrishna's intense practice of spiritual disciplines, 
i.e. the so-called sādhana period, during Ramakrishna's "teaching period" when his followers and subsequent 
bearers of his message began to flock to him, of which of course Mahendranath Gupta himself was one. 
The last of the primary sources of detailed biographical accounts of Ramakrishna's life and teachings which is 
leveraged throughout Kālī's Child was also written in Bengali by one of Ramakrishna's foremost monastic 
disciples, Swami Saradananda as Srī Srī Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga, or The Divine Play of Srī Ramakrishna and 
was published in 5 volumes between 1909 and 1919.  This work is by far the most detailed and well 
researched account of Ramakrishna which not only includes a detailed history and account of all of the 
relevant biographical aspects of Ramakrishna's life which includes accounts and perspectives of virtually all 
people that were associated with, or came into contact with and/or influenced Ramakrishna, but also 
represents the most technically detailed account of Ramakrishna's spiritual life and experiences, all viewed 
(appropriately) through the very specific Hindu and Indian theo-philosophical tradition within which 
Ramakrishna squarely rests.  This work is the subject of much criticism in Kālī's Child as not only being 
inconsistent with in many respects with the aforementioned biographical accounts of Ramakrishna that were 
written by householder disciples, but also as overly emphasizing the Vedantic aspects of Ramakrishna's 
spiritual practices and to a large degree ignoring and/or deemphasizing the specifically Tantric aspect of 
Ramakrishna's sādhana which of course is the cornerstone of Dr. Kripal's argument and rationale behind his 
"scandalous" and "homoerotic" interpretation of Ramakrishna that arguably represents the overarching 
theme of Kālī's Child.

 
Figure 38: Swami Saradananda, the direct monastic disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahansa 

This monumental work was translated into the English by Swami Jagadananda with the alternate title Srī 
Ramakrishna, The Great Master which was first published in 1952.   Swami Saradananda was one of the 
foremost and influential members of Ramakrishna's 12 monastic disciples who went on to serve as the 
General Secretary of the Ramakrishna Order from the time the organization was founded in 1897 until his 
death in 1927, during which time (after 1902) he also served as the editor of the Udbodhan, the Bengali 
journal published by the Ramakrishna Order.  Swami Saradananda also notably was responsible for looking 
after and caring for Sarada Devi, aka Holy Mother, the holy consort and wife of Ramakrishna, during much of 
this period.  It was in fact from the house that was purchased in Calcutta in 1909 for the purpose of housing 
and caring for Sarada Devi from which Swami Saradananda performed much of his editing work on the 
Udbodhan as well as where he wrote the bulk of Srī Srī Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga.  Swami Saradananda is 
also known for overseeing the construction of the two temples that were built in honor of Holy Mother, one 
on the spot of her cremation within the grounds of the Belur Math, the headquarters of the Ramakrishna 
Order in West Bengal, which was completed in 1921, and then a second temple that was constructed on the 
spot of her birthplace in Jayrambati in West Bengal which was completed in 1925.
Swami Saradananda's work, and its English translation, is arguably the definitive Indian theo-philosophical 
account of Ramakrishna as a spiritual aspirant as seen through the eyes of not only a direct disciple and 
student of Ramakrishna himself, but also as seen from the perspective of a renunciate and monastic who by 
definition has dedicated their entire life to "living" or "embodying" the teachings of Ramakrishna.  Given that 
this work was written from this unique perspective, it should come as no surprise that his account and 
interpretation of Ramakrishna's spiritual experiences differs in many respects from that of Mahendranath 
Gupta or Ram Chandra Datta, both of whom were householders and therefore were, according to the entire 
literary tradition surrounding Ramakrishna, were not only subject to a different set of teachings and precepts 
regarding spiritual life, but whom also clearly led very different lives, with very different pressures and 
influences, than that of Ramakrishna's monastic disciples of which Swami Saradananda was an exemplary 
member of. 
In fact, one of the major criticisms of Swami Saradananda's account of Ramakrishna's sādhana and spiritual 
experiences in Kālī's Child - the description and interpretation of which arguably structures the work as a 
whole and also represents a significant portion of the work itself and is based not only on other first and 
second hand accounts that were researched as part of the work, but also based upon what Swami 
Saradananda was taught from Ramakrishna directly - is that in many respects Swami Saradananda's account 
is inconsistent with the other two biographical accounts that are used in Kālī's Child as primary sources.  
Furthermore, in Kālī's Child, Swami Saradananda (again relative to the other two householder biographical 
accounts of Ramakrishna that are leveraged as source material) over emphasizes the non-dual Vedānta, i.e. 
Advaita Vedānta aspect of Ramakrishna's sādhana over the "Tantric", or "erotic" and worldly elements of his 
spiritual practices, which of course runs counter to the very basic arguments and conclusions in Kālī's Child 
with regard to how best to characterize Ramakrishna's spiritual life as a whole which sets the stage for the 
"scandalous" and "eroticized" interpretation therein.  Hence the reason why Kālī's Child as a whole tends to 
discount and/or downplay, generally speaking, Swami Saradananda's account of Ramakrishna's spiritual 
practices, as well as his interpretation thereof, relative to the other two (householder) narratives.  
However, it should not come as much of a surprise to the reader, given the different teaching styles and 
methods that were employed by Ramakrishna depending upon the overall capacity, bent and disposition of 
the student, that his householder teachings in general would include more "erotic" or "sexual" innuendos 
and references than those delivered to his monastic disciples, of which again Swami Saradananda was a 
prominent member of.  For at their very core, the monastic disciple has "renounced" physical desires and has 
specifically taken a vow with respect to the yielding to sexual desires specifically, to serve as an example of 
the ultimate end and highest manifestation of spiritual life in general from an Indian theo-philosophical 
perspective.  This point is made repeatedly not just by Ramakrishna himself, but again is completely 
integrated into the Indian theo-philosophical tradition itself within which Ramakrishna was taught and within 
which his own spiritual practices were performed.
As mentioned, a good portion of Swami Saradananda's work regarding Ramakrishna is spent not just 
providing detailed technical descriptions and accounts of Ramakrishna's spiritual disciplines and experiences 
within the specific Indian theo-philosophical context of said practices, but also a detailed account of said 
experiences as Swami Saradananda understood them based upon his own spiritual practices and disciplines 
within the very same Indian theo-philosophical context and from the very same vantage point, i.e. that of a 
total renunciate of the world.  This vantage point Swami Saradananda shared with Ramakrishna whereas 
Mahendranath Gupta and Ram Chandra Datta did not, as they were still creatures of the world to a large 
extent, despite the fact that they were of course nonetheless ardent devotees of Ramakrishna as well as very 
deep and profound mystics in and of themselves.  
And of course given the spiritual stature of Swami Saradananda himself, as not just reflective of one who has 
devoted their entire life, the every core of his being, to the teachings of Ramakrishna - which is the very 
definition of a renunciate or a monastic disciple as viewed relative to a householder disciple in the Indian 
theo-philosophical and Hindu socio-cultural landscape - but also as one who, as arguably one of the foremost 
of all of Ramakrishna's disciples and spiritual successors, is an individual who from a "mystical" perspective 
comes as close as possible, or at least closer relative to the householder disciples in question, to having first-
hand experiences that are akin to those which Ramakrishna himself experienced and which he describes and 
interprets from within the very same Indian theo-philosophical framework that Ramakrishna had his spiritual 
experiences.   In other words, Swami Saradananda was in a very unique position in fact to be able to not just 
provide unique insights into Ramakrishna's spiritual experiences in and of themselves, but also to bring to 
bear his own personal spiritual experiences as it related to those of Ramakrishna's as seen through the eyes 
of a practitioner and follower of the very same disciplines and forms of worship which Ramakrishna himself 
practiced, from the very same perspective that Ramakrishna himself had, i.e. as a renunciate in the fullest 
sense of the term. 

Also very relevant to this discussion here with respect to the merits and perspective of Swami Saradananda's 
account and interpretation of Ramakrishna's sādhana and related spiritual experiences relative to the other 
two householder accounts are relied on so heavily in Kālī's Child is the use and interpretation of a term called 
Bhavamukha, one that is unique in fact to the tradition surrounding Ramakrishna and one that has no 
precedent within the Indian theo-philosophical landscape prior to him in fact.  This term is almost written off 
due to its limited use in the Indian philosophical literature as a whole, a phenomenon that is referred to as a 
hapax legomenon, a word for whose contextual meaning there exists only a single (hapax) occurrence.   
While this is not altogether technically accurate, as the term is used many times throughout all three of the 
source texts surrounding Ramakrishna that Dr. Kripal relies heavily on, speaking to the overall significance 
and relevance of the term itself from Ramakrishna's own perspective as he clearly used it on many occasions 
and in many contexts to describe his state of consciousness specifically, both with householder as well as 
monastic disciples, the characterization of the phrase as a hapax legomenon does nonetheless reflect the fact 
that the term is used only within the context of the life and teachings of Ramakrishna himself and does not 
exist in any of the other major Indian theo-philosophical literature that exists before him.  
As such, Bhavamukha as a theo-philosophical principle which is associated with and co-emerges with 
Ramakrishna himself, and therefore is defined by, and is basically co-equivalent to, Ramakrishna's state of 
"being" in and of itself as it is reflected, according to Swami Saradananda's account, during the so-called 
"teaching" phase of his life.  A phase which, again according to Swami Saradananda, followed directly after 
his sādhana phase which culminates in his experience of nirvikalpa samādhi for a continuous six month 
period where he was supposedly only kept alive by the kindness of some strange man, an itinerant monk, 
that forced him to eat.   Bhavamukha is very loosely translated into English as "the sweet mood", or "on 
the verge of the ultimate" but of course carries with it very specific and technical theo-philosophical 
significance, in particular with respect to Ramakrishna's sādhana as a whole.  Swami Saradananda relates 
that the reason that Ramakrishna is told to remain in this state, and again this comes from Ramakrishna 
himself, is so that he could remain in his physical form for the benefit of his devotees, and in turn for the 
spiritual benefit of the world in general.  For if he did not come "down" to this level of consciousness, down 
from the state of nirvikalpa samādhi which he had remained in for six months, he would have effectively died 
as all identification with his physical form, his body would have completely dissolved.  As such, it was 
necessary for some level of ego consciousness to remain such that his physical form would persist.
This term Bhavamukha emphasizes the "relative" condition and disposition of Ramakrishna's state of mind as 
it related primarily to the goddess Kālī, and should be viewed as a very general description and 
characterization of his "state of being" rather than the technical, mystical description of any state of mind per 
se - like for example the term samādhi which carries with it a very specific and relevant theo-philosophical 
and Indian philosophical historical and spiritual context.  It is very relevant and worth pointing out that 
despite the widespread use of this term by Swami Saradananda throughout his biographical work in toto, a 
work which he spent a good two decades or research and writing to pull together and which also included 
and integrated what he was told directly by Ramakrishna himself as one of his most prominent and advanced 
monastic disciples, the term is almost entirely disregarded, and in fact is directly attacked as inconsistent and 
irrational, even in the second and wholly revised and updated version of Kālī's Child.
And this term that Ramakrishna himself uses, and one which Swami Saradananda in fact takes great pains to 
explain not just the meaning of but also the significance of, i.e. its interpretation as it were, runs counter to 
the entire argument in Kālī's Child that the primary means, or lens, through which the "proper" 
understanding of Ramakrishna's sādhana in general, i.e. how his sādhana Is to be "interpreted", is one that is 
fundamentally categorized by the "erotic", i.e. is inherently Tantric, given the role that Kālī herself and the 
related symbology surrounding her (as reflected in the statue in the Dakshineswar Temple for example where 
Kālī stands over Śiva in symbolic representation of the cosmic domination of the female over the male which 
is an inherently Tantric symbol which is covered in detail in Kālī's Child as illustrative and exemplarity of 
Ramakrishna as a fundamentally Tantric devotee) plays in Ramakrishna's devotional life.  
But Swami Saradananda's account of Ramakrishna's achievement of the ultimate state of absorption, the 
direct experience of Satcitānanda as it were, after his Vedantic spiritual practices under the direct guidance 
and instruction of the renunciate monk Totapuri, to the point where he almost gave up his body entirely, and 
after which he was directly instructed to remain in a very specific state of mind relative to the divine such 
that his physical form could continue to exist, or persist, that Ramakrishna himself referred to as 
Bhavamukha, signifies very specifically Ramakrishna's fundamental state of being relative to the divine as a 
human incarnation thereof and is the description that Ramakrishna himself provides for his overall state of 
"existence" and state of mind in general as it reflects his disposition toward and related to Satcitānanda, the 
very end goal of Vedānta which Ramakrishna fully "realized" as reflected in the state of nirvikalpa samādhi 
which he remained in continuously for almost six months, an accomplishment that for all intents and 
purposes is super human and has never before been documented within the history of the Indian and Hindu 
theo-philosophical tradition as a whole. 
While it is clear that this very specific Indian theo-philosophical term is very critical to understanding or 
interpreting Ramakrishna from any sort of psychological perspective, as limited as these frameworks might 
be, we are left with simply one explanation of the term within the context of the Indian theo-philosophical 
landscape as a whole, and that is from Swami Saradananda's account, one which is almost altogether 
discounted in Kālī's Child based primarily upon the fact that from a linear, timing and order of occurrence 
perspective, his division and relative importance or value that he places upon the various aspects or 
components of Ramakrishna's sādhana - the sum total of which in their various parts are however consistent 
in all three primary source accounts that are used in Kālī's Child, despite their different ordering and/or 
different emphasis in the respective biographical accounts themselves (a fact that the author has already 
pointed out is easily explained by the fact that the householder teachings and monastic teachings are very 
well known to have been of a fundamentally different nature, type and emphasis as explained by 
Ramakrishna himself as well as detailed in virtually all of biographical narratives and accounts of the life and 
teachings of Ramakrishna).
Within the context of Swami Saradananda's account of the so-called "command" by the goddess Kālī herself 
of Ramakrishna to remain in the state of Bhavamukha, is that it is fundamentally related to, or using Dr. 
Kripal's linear and very literal perspective on Ramakrishna's sādhana phase as a whole (one that is altogether 
Western in and of itself and is not necessarily the one that is implied and or presumed in Swami 
Saradananda's work, which at some level should not be surprising given that he is looking to, more so than 
any of the other biographical accounts of Ramakrishna, "interpret" and make sense of Ramakrishna as a 
religious and spiritual figure within the overall Hindu and Indian theo-philosophical landscape that he 
emerges from and out of.  In other words, the rationale that is used in Kālī's Child in order to discount Swami 
Saradananda's account and interpretation which is embedded therein is fundamentally flawed in and of 
itself, applying a certain and very specifically Western intellectual metaphysical framework and benchmark 
upon it for "accuracy" which is fundamentally foreign to the tradition itself that it is describing and/or 
interpreting.
According to Swami Saradananda's account then, this "command" comes from the Mother goddess herself 
after that after Ramakrishna achieves what he perceives to be, from his own interpretation of the meaning 
and import of the life and teachings of Ramakrishna of course, one which fundamentally differs from the 
householder accounts primary because its intention is not just one of the narration of the wondrous and 
amazing events which came about during their respective association with Ramakrishna, but because it's very 
purpose as a work in and of itself is to make sense of Ramakrishna as a religious persona within the context 
of the Indian theo-philosophical landscape, one which arguably underpins the entire Indo-European theo-
philosophical heritage, as is argued and which makes up a significant theme throughout this work.  
To discount Swami Saradananda's account then, based upon a set of entirely foreign criteria to the topic in 
question is not only flawed, but it undermines the essential argument of Kālī's Child which characterizes 
Ramakrishna's sādhana as primarily Tantric, which is not just inconsistent with Swami Saradananda's 
perspective but is almost diametrically opposed to and fundamentally different from said perspective.  
Furthermore, the very fact that Dr. Kripal calls into question the validity and importance and relevance of 
Swami Saradananda's account in general, again based primarily upon the application of a wholly foreign set 
of criteria with respect to "accuracy", given Swami Saradananda's place within the inner circle of 
Ramakrishna's monastic disciples, as well as the consistency of Swami Saradananda's account of the 
interpretation of Ramakrishna's sādhana, and the meaning or interpretation of it as understood by the term 
Bhavamukha specifically (more below), with virtually the entirety of Swami Vivekananda's interpretation of 
Ramakrishna as it should be understood as a reflection of Ramakrishna's message, meaning and 
"interpretation" as a whole, not just calls into question the rational foundations of Kālī's Child, but also 
implies that the "Western" perspective is more "accurate" or "true" that the "Eastern" or "insider" 
perspective which is reflected first and foremost in the teachings of his monastic disciples, namely Swami 
Saradananda and/or Swami Vivekananda themselves, both of who were not only intimate consorts and 
students and disciples of Ramakrishna of course, and as such were subject to his teachings both from a literal 
and intellectual perspective but also from a spiritual and experiential perspective as well and therefore were 
in the best possible position, relative to any specific individual who has ever existed or who will ever exist in 
fact, to "interpret" Ramakrishna and any assertion to the contrary is not only (as much as the author is 
reluctant to use such strong language) represents the very height of arrogance as well as the very height of 
ignorance, and furthermore reflects at a very basic level an undercurrent of racism that continues to persist 
in academic circles with respect to the relative importance, validity and overall value of classically Western 
intellectual frameworks over the alternative classically Eastern intellectual frameworks (an ontological 
question that is dealt with at length below). 
Given this context then, and placing a great deal of significance and importance to Swami Saradananda's 
account and interpretation of Ramakrishna as well as Swami Vivekananda's which can be viewed as a 
reflection of the entirety of his message in fact, the way Swami Saradananda describes Bhavamukha is as the 
very ultimate state of consciousness or existence that any human form can manifest or experience on a 
consistent basis and still remain in said human form.  Again the term is defined, in a somewhat circular 
fashion again, as "the" very definition of Ramakrishna's state of mind in relation to the divine, that he 
manifests for the rest of his life after his sādhana phase, i.e. his Teaching phase.  
Swami Saradananda then describes it within the context of the overall Indian the-philosophical landscape, 
using terminology that anyone familiar with Yoga, Sāṃkhya or Vedānta would be intimately familiar with - 
i.e. in terms of Saguna Brahman versus Nirguna Brahman, Puruṣa and Prakṛti, in terms of the overall validity 
and spectrum of relative truth to all three basic Vedānta schools, i.e. non-dualistic, qualified non-dualistic, 
and dualistic, etc. - the sum total of which Swami Saradananda makes a point to express should be 
understood, as it was expressed and taught to him by Ramakrishna himself (maybe not using that language 
necessarily but is nonetheless an expression of Ramakrishna's teaching nonetheless according to Swami 
Saradananda), as all being real and true, simply being terminology that is used depending upon the specific 
(Indian) theo-philosophical perspective of the aspirant in question, i.e. the sādhaka.   
In fact, left out of this vert detailed account and description by Swami Saradananda of Bhavamukha as a 
theo-philosophical construct which is reflected and manifest in Ramakrishna himself, is the very methodology 
and theo-philosophical framework that is used in Kālī's Child as the most "accurate" way to "interpret" 
Ramakrishna, i.e. Tantra Yoga which is based upon the dualism of the Female and Male primordial (and 
erotic) principles of the universe which are manifest in the divine interplay of Śakti and Śiva.  While Swami 
Saradananda does express and define Bhavamukha in terms of Puruṣa and Prakṛti, the basic dualism that sits 
behind Sāṃkhya philosophy, this is not equivalent to the Tantric notions of Śiva and Śakti, even though they 
"might" be related, with emphasis on might here because the relationship is not altogether clear.  There is a 
notable ignorance displayed in  on the nature and subtleties of the relation between this distinct and yet 
altogether related (related in terms of common origins and parent rather than related to each other as one 
being the direct descendant of another, a very significant difference especially within the context of the 
overall argument for characterizing Ramakrishna's sādhana as fundamentally Tantric) in his description of 
Sāṃkhya philosophy and its underlying theo-philosophical relationship to Tantra Yoga. 
What is very interesting here, and another very important point that is entirely overlooked in Kālī's Child, is 
that Swami Saradananda's description of Bhavamukha is given within the context of the overall (orthodox) 
Indian theo-philosophical landscape where no school is perceived to be false necessarily, but that all schools 
should be viewed as true along a relative spectrum of existence that is fundamentally measured by the 
degree of "I" consciousness that exists, with Advaita Vedānta existing on one end of the spectrum, arguably 
the "highest" or "most complete" description of reality or the fundamental nature of existence and then the 
dualistic form of Vedānta arguably representing the lowest, or other end of said spectrum where the "I" of 
the sādhaka continues to exist in order to, and is defined relative to, Īśvara as the focus of the jiva's worship.  
As such, this entire theo-philosophical landscape is described not just in terms of Vedānta - in again its non-
dualistic, qualified non-dualistic and dualistic forms - but also in terms of Sāṃkhya philosophy as a whole 
(Puruṣa and Prakṛti) as well as of course Yoga which is where the term samādhi is sourced from to begin with.  
What we are left with of course, is almost exactly the same teaching of Swami Vivekananda even though this 
teaching is cast in a somewhat more different, and more simplified, light - i.e. within the context of four 
different aspects of Yoga, namely Jnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga and Bhakti Yoga - which all work 
together for the ultimate mokṣa, or liberation of the sādhaka, or spiritual aspirant.  The only real difference 
between the two teachings - Swami Saradananda's and Swami Vivekananda's - is really one of emphasis and 
focus rather than one of import or content.  That is to say Swami Saradananda's is put forth to explain and 
interpret Ramakrishna specifically and Swami Vivekananda's teaching is put forth as a "translation" of 
Ramakrishna's message for all humanity in terms that are approachable and practical and comprehensible to 
the West in general.  
Both teachings, both interpretations of Ramakrishna's true meaning and "message" however, nonetheless 
rest not only on the very same (Indian/Hindu) theo-philosophical framework which is a much more broad and 
fully integrated view of all orthodox systems of Indian philosophy, i.e. those that rest on the ultimate verity 
and truth of the Vedas, which is reflects in Swami Vivekananda's recasting and more broad definition of 
Vedānta that we find as a common theme that is prevalent throughout all of the literature that he leaves 
behind in fact that reflect this set of teachings.  
Furthermore, both Swami Saradananda's interpretation as well as Swami Vivekananda's interpretation of the 
true message of Ramakrishna also rest on the very same principle of the ultimate truth of the entire 
spectrum and interpretations of the "entire" Indian theo-philosophical landscape into a single, unified whole.  
This is the modern version of Vedānta that Swami Vivekananda teaches, is the very same theo-philosophical 
language and description that Swami Saradananda uses to describe Bhavamukha as the penultimate term to 
describe Ramakrishna's teaching phase of his life, or his state of existence after his sādhana phase - an 
understanding of which arguably any interpretation of him must rest in fact.  In fact, one of the reasons why 
Dr. Kripal is so apt to "misinterpret" Ramakrishna as fundamentally Tantric is because he clearly does not 
appear to grasp the true significance and import of said recasting of Vedānta as it is described by both Swami 
Saradananda and Swami Vivekananda.  He chooses to take a narrower definitional perspective on this theo-
philosophical system, as reflected in Ramakrishna's sādhana under the guidance of Totapuri specifically, 
rather than how the term is used in all of the "interpretative" literature that surrounds Ramakrishna after his 
death by his monastic disciples, the ones that are put in charge of bringing his "message" to the world in fact.
Needless to say, this entire dimension of Swami Saradananda's description of Bhavamukha and its ultimate 
almost complete and total alignment with Swami Vivekananda's teachings, are completely lost on Dr. Kripal 
and are buried, or perhaps more aptly put altogether ignored, in lieu of the fact that Swami Saradananda's 
narration and ordering of the events of Ramakrishna's sādhana, as well as the relative emphasis that he 
places on Vedānta in general (again this more expansive sense of Vedānta that we describe here) over Tantra 
Yoga, and the fact that he almost virtually ignores Tantra entirely as a means to best interpret Ramakrishna, 
is used to not better understand how to interpret Ramakrishna but is used as an argument as to why Swami 
Saradananda's account should be discounted, and fundamentally ignored really.
What is entirely ignored in Kālī's Child (or perhaps what is just quite simply overlooked because it flies in the 
face of the overall thesis) is that it should be expected that Swami Saradananda's account and understanding 
of Ramakrishna's sādhana is different than the accounts of Mahendranath Gupta as well as Ram Chandra 
Datta, or from any other householder disciple of Ramakrishna for that matter, as it is very well documented 
throughout the entire tradition surrounding Ramakrishna in fact (and is a very consistent and widespread 
characteristic of Yogic and Eastern theo-philosophical traditions in general) that the teaching methods, tools 
and practices that are "prescribed" or given to monastics is of a wholly different nature than that given to so-
called "householders", i.e. those who were not in a position to "renounce" the world for whatever reason.  
Ramakrishna's teaching style follows this tradition quite strictly in fact, and not only do we find extensive 
evidence and accounts of the description and general characterization of Ramakrishna's teachings styles, 
dictums, methods, emphasis and even underlying overall approach and understanding of the divine tailored 
to each of his students and disciples, given their own strengths and weaknesses as well their own individual 
psychological and socio-cultural backgrounds and predilections, but also widespread and very well 
documented accounts that in general, Ramakrishna's teachings to monastics and householders was of an 
altogether different type and emphasis altogether, no doubt stemming from the fact that Ramakrishna 
understood well in advance of the founding of the Ramakrishna Order by Vivekananda that the pressures and 
stress that his monastic disciples would undergo and pass through after his passing and after his "work" in 
the world would begin, spear headed by Swami Vivekananda of course, would be of an altogether very 
different and unique nature relative to his householder disciples which would remain "in the world" so to 
speak. 
Ramakrishna's monastic disciples in fact, and clearly Ramakrishna knew this, would not only be subject to the 
highest moral and ethical standards in fact, standards viewed within the context of an ascetic and monastic 
theo-philosophical tradition within India that was at least 3 millennia old (if not older) but also would be the 
subjects of a more direct, complete, and more full realization of the spiritual "realities" and "experiences" 
which Ramakrishna himself experienced and which he passed on directly to them, as the monastics, given the 
extent of their dedication and commitment, would be by definition capable of "withstanding" such 
revelations and thereby coming to a more complete and better "understanding" of the nature of existence 
and the meaning of his sādhana in general, than his householder disciples.   Not surprisingly, the teachings 
that were delivered and instructed to Ramakrishna's monastic disciples was of a more intense and 
"renunciate" and non-dual nature, at least according to Swami Saradananda and Swami Vivekananda) 
characterization and interpretation of his teachings.  Relative of course to the teachings given to the 
householder disciples which, not surprisingly, would be of a more "worldly", or perhaps even "erotic", i.e. 
Tantric, nature.
Furthermore, not only is Swami Saradananda's account of Ramakrishna's life and teachings discounted 
throughout Kālī's Child, but also Swami Vivekananda's teachings and thoughts regarding the true meaning 
and import of Ramakrishna's life and teachings, of which in fact the entire corpus and life work of Swami 
Vivekananda represents in fact, are also almost entirely ignored in Kālī's Child.  And anyone with familiarity 
with Vivekananda's massive corpus of English texts on Indian philosophy in general, and on Vedānta and Yoga 
in particular, can readily see that Vivekananda's teachings are much more aligned with, and in many respects 
remain perfectly consistent with (not surprisingly) Swami Saradananda's depiction of Ramakrishna as 
reflected in his biography of him which includes of course an implicit "interpretation" and understanding of 
not only Ramakrishna's sādhana, but also the final message and import of his spiritual practices as is to be 
taught and carried on, primarily by his monastic disciple - NOT in fact by his householder disciples who were 
delivered an altogether different perspective and account of his spiritual experiences as well as how they 
should be interpreted from a practical standpoint given their lives as householders. 
As a further significant defect in Kālī's Child with respect to which sources are looked to as "authentic" or 
most true, or what sources again are included at all, it is important to point out that virtually no mention is 
made or any significance attached to the teachings or stories regarding Ramakrishna from his spiritual 
consort and wife, Sarada Devi, despite the fact that she was his spouse and shared a house with him for some 
20 years and was his spiritual successor in many respects as well, tasked with continuing his work to a large 
extent with respect to initiating and teaching spiritual aspirants and students and delivering and passing on 
the basic message of his teaching to them - just as in fact Swami Vivekananda and the rest of the monastic 
disciples of Ramakrishna were tasked with who founded the Ramakrishna Order.  At one point in fact, in 
again a very well documented incident by M., Ramakrishna directly worshipped Sarada Devi as a 
manifestation of the divine Mother of the universe, and after doing so remained in a very high, ecstatic state 
of divine bliss for some time thereafter.  Given the importance and significance of such an event, as well as 
the importance and significance of the role of Sarada Devi within Ramakrishna's life and teaching in general, 
one would think - especially if one were trying to understand Ramakrishna through a very narrow Tantric, i.e. 
erotic and sexual lens, that her understanding of him as a spiritual aspirant and teacher, as well as what his 
overall message and meaning and import was, would be consulted and in fact highly regarded.  But that is in 
fact not the case.  Furthermore, and of course related to this very point, If one is attempting to frame 
Ramakrishna's psychological mindset and characterize his spiritual practices in toto in terms of the basic and 
primordial conception of the universe as the interaction and interplay of the Male (Śiva) and Female (Śakti), 
one must arguably closely analyze these very principles within the context of his marital life, i.e. as it 
manifested most concretely and directly in his relationship with his wife, i.e. Sarada Devi (1853 - 1920), aka 
Holy Mother. 
Again, how this very important distinction between the two arguably quite distinctive approaches and 
methods, and in turn no doubt underlying theo-philosophical frameworks within which said methods and 
teachings were given, which is clearly outlined in virtually all of the biographical and historical accounts of 
Ramakrishna be they originate from the accounts of householder or monastic devotees, is missed in Kālī's 
Child is somewhat incredulous in fact and reflects either a) a fundamental misconception and 
misunderstanding of the transmission methods of the Eastern, and in this case more specifically Indian, theo-
philosophical tradition as a whole (which go back thousands of years in fact as reflected in both the Indian 
philosophical tradition, which includes Buddhism), b) reflects a conscious disregard of such fact when 
considering the evidence and context of the source material in question.  
The latter option is of course the more serious accusation of the two, but either alternative rationale (or 
some third option that the author has not conceived of) is almost superfluous and inconsequential as it 
relates to the irrefutable conclusion that must be drawn that Kālī's Child's contextual misapprehension and 
misunderstanding of the tradition surrounding the transmission of Indian theo-philosophy as a whole, within 
which Ramakrishna squarely sits of course no matter how you choose to characterize the emphasis of his 
sādhana (more on this below), represents a major, and almost completely destructive and dare we say 
catastrophic, failure of the rational basis for virtually the entire thesis that is presented in Kālī's Child.  A 
thesis which rests on the assumption that Ramakrishna's sādhana should be characterized and viewed 
through a primarily Tantric, and therefore through a sexually charged and "erotic" lens (which is only one 
aspect of Tantra in fact, more on this below) which is more prominently reflected and emphasized in the 
sources documented above which were authored by so-called "householders" disciples and students of 
Ramakrishna.  
In fact Kālī's Child consistently and persistently emphasizes that these "householder" biographical sources 
are more authentic and represent a more "accurate" and "truthful" narration of the description of 
Ramakrishna's spiritual life and experiences than the account given by Swami Saradananda - when in fact the 
reverse is actually true from a pure theo-philosophical perspective as anyone with any direct experience with 
the transmission practices and methods of Eastern philosophy and spirituality would attest to.  This very 
narrow selection of source material, combined with his very narrow interpretative lens that is used, along 
with the arguably invalid or misrepresentation of the relative potency or authenticity of the limited resources 
that are used, all add up to very significant, fundamental and inherent rational and logical flaws that underpin 
the entire argument and thesis of Kālī's Child and therefore call into question any conclusions or perspectives 
that are drawn therein on the life and teaching, and ultimate "interpretation" of Ramakrishna.

Next let us analyze the basic underlying assumption which sits at the very heart of Kripal's assessment and 
basic characterization of Ramakrishna's sādhana as fundamentally "Tantric", an assessment and 
categorization which rests at the very heart of Kālī's Child's conclusions regarding the source and nature of 
Ramakrishna's behavior as being most accurately viewed within a sexual and erotic context and therefore 
lend themselves to interpretation by a classically Freudian psychoanalytical intellectual framework and as 
such are "explained", or in turn best "interpreted" as a direct result of repressed homoerotic tendencies 
and/or are the result of traumatic sexual experiences that he experienced during and throughout his 
sādhana, a period which lasts some 12 years and which culminates in his 6 month absorption in nirvikalpa 
samādhi (what is described in Kālī's Child incidentally as a "catatonic" state) after which he claims to have 
been directed by Kālī herself to come back down to "reality" and serve humanity in a state which is referred 
to by Swami Saradananda as Bhavamukha, a term and a state that is challenged quite directly in Kālī's Child 
as inconsistent with the other, i.e. householder, descriptions of his spiritual experiences on the basis of what 
Kripal refers to as Saradananda's basic misunderstanding and misrepresentation in fact of Ramakrishna's 
entire sādhana practices in their entirety. 
Part of the uniqueness, and one of the major challenges in fact, of classifying Ramakrishna within this basic 
Hindu and Vedic theo-philosophical and spiritual landscape in fact is that his sādhana was so extensive, and 
so exhaustive in many respects at least from a Hindu and Vedic perspective, that it is difficult to uniquely 
characterize or qualify Ramakrishna as a practitioner or adept under just one specific school of Hindu or 
Indian theo-philosophy.  His sādhana phase of his life, according to most accounts, took place for a period of 
almost 12 years and, according to Swami Saradananda at least, culminated in his experience of total 
absorption in the Absolute (Brahman or Satcitānanda according to the Vedic philosophy) according the 
tradition of Advaita Vedānta which Ramakrishna studied under the wandering ascetic monk Totapuri.
These broad ranging set of spiritual disciplines and practices that Ramakrishna followed at one time or 
another over the course of his lengthy and intense phase of sādhana during the middle period of his life 
when he served as the high priest at the Kālī Temple at Dakshineswar Temple near Calcutta ranged from an 
Indian and Hindu perspective across Tantra Yoga (as taught to him by the female ascetic and teacher Bhairavi 
Brahmani), to classic "Vedic" (in particular that of the Advaita Vedānta school as expounded by Śaṅkara 
which Ramakrishna practiced under the guidance and tutelage of Totapuri), as well as various forms of Bhakti 
Yoga, or devotional forms of Hindu worship, such as Vaishnava Bhakti and Rāma Bhakti to name the most 
prominent and well documented examples.  He even practiced spiritual disciplines and modes of worship of 
non-Hindu religious traditions and spiritual practices as reflected by his foray into Islam as well as 
Christianity, again making it even more difficult to not just classify him within the context of the Hindu/Vedic 
theo-philosophical tradition as a whole, but even to classify him within the context of simply the Hindu 
religious tradition as a whole. 
This conundrum, mystery and unique attribute of Ramakrishna spiritual practices which are arguably the 
most well documented in the history of "prophetic" like historical figures in the history mankind, is arguably 
the defining characteristic of Ramakrishna as a spiritual "seer" and religious figure and therefore represents 
perhaps one of the biggest challenges from an interpretative standpoint in fact, to try and understand him 
through a classical, and predominantly Western of course, intellectual framework such as is reflected in the 
more modern discipline of Comparative Religion within which Dr. Kripal as an academic and a scholar 
squarely rests.  The breadth and expanse of Ramakrishna's spiritual practices, which really defy simply 
categorization and/or classification, is arguably one of the main sources and reasons behind the so-called 
"insider" versus "outsider" sides of the "Interpreting Ramakrishna" debate as it is framed and discussed 
herein and arguably is also one of the main reasons why he his such an enigmatic and influential, and again in 
the context of this particular debate, as controversial as figure as he is, almost defying definition or 
classification of any sort from any sort of specific or narrowly defined theo-philosophical or religious 
perspective in fact.
This unique characteristic, or "quality" which is a hallmark of Ramakrishna and the theo-philosophical 
tradition that surrounds him as a whole, as it is reflected both in the events of his life (which are all very well 
recorded and documented) as well as with respect to his so-called "teachings" as we have come to 
understand them through the eyes and texts that have been left behind by many of his closest confidantes 
and students, is one of the main sources of confusion, and in turn misunderstanding or misconception, of 
how Ramakrishna is to be "interpreted" or again "understood", not just an historical and influential religious 
figure, but as a psychological phenomenon in and of itself.  

The term sādhu, is a Sanskrit word which literally translates as "holy man" and is the term given to a Hindu 
religious ascetic or holy person.  It comes from the same root as the Sanskrit word, sādhana, which as has 
been pointed out throughout this work signifies Vedic and/or Hindu "spiritual practices" which in and of 
themselves serve to define and classify said sādhaka into one or more specific schools of Indian philosophy.  
As such, a sādhaka can be said to be "classified" or "characterized" by the specific sādhana that they 
practice.  
The standard interpretation of the wide range of sādhana that was practiced by Ramakrishna, and again this 
comes from the direct first hand sources who were taught by Ramakrishna himself, most notably of course by 
his spiritual successor Swami Vivekananda, is that the breadth of his sādhana, and the assertion that he 
effectively "fulfilled" or "realized" the goal of each and every type or class of sādhana that he practiced not 
only represents one of, if not the, defining characteristic of Ramakrishna as a spiritual and religious figure in 
the history of the world.  And that in light of these facts, his defining message, if it can be articulated or 
summed up in a single sentence or idea, is that Ramakrishna as a religious figure in and of himself reflects 
and exemplifies, and in turn embodies more less the concept or proof of, the so-called "harmony" of all 
religions.  
Put in another way, Ramakrishna's spiritual practices when looked at in toto, operating under the assumption 
that he did in fact realize the very end or goal of each and every set of sādhana that he practiced or 
"underwent", effectively "proves" that the end of all religious systems, their penultimate goal, is precisely the 
same despite their seemingly broad range of superficial differences - and that this in turn is the best, and 
simplest, way to "interpret" Ramakrishna in the modern era that is characterized from a religious standpoint 
as one of strife and conflict and a focus on religious (and racial) differences as opposed to the ultimate truth 
that they all fundamentally at their core carry the same message.  This message is summed up in the Vedic 
adage that is used so often within the "insider" community, "Truth is one, sages call it by various names".
This very unique characteristic that is fundamental to Ramakrishna both as a religious practitioner and 
teacher, and which is also reflected in his sādhana as well in toto, is arguably one of the main reasons behind 
some of what can only be described as the very basic and fundamental misinterpretations or misconceptions 
of Ramakrishna that are presented in Kālī's Child.  In this work, there is a far-reaching attempt to "interpret" 
or perhaps better put "frame" Ramakrishna's spiritual practices as much as possible squarely within the 
discipline and context of "Tantra".  Kālī's Child goes to great lengths to emphasize Ramakrishna's Tantric 
spiritual practices and disciplines relative to the other, very well documented and studied, other types of 
spiritual practices and disciplines that Ramakrishna also practiced, many of which fall outside of Tantra Yoga 
as a spiritual discipline no matter how broad a definition of Tantra Yoga is used.  
Once he does this, given the erotic and sexual connotations and symbols that are inherent to and 
characterize the spiritual practices and disciplines that typically fall under the heading of "Tantra Yoga" as it is 
understood in the West in the modern era (most notably in the so-called "left-handed" path of Tantra, more 
below), this allows Kālī's Child to then categorize and describe Ramakrishna's behavior, and in turn make 
certain presumptions about his state of mind and/or the driving force behind such behavior, based upon the 
standard, modern, Western psychoanalytical theory, i.e. Freudian psychology.  This is the basic and 
overarching outline of Kālī's Child and it all fundamental rests upon the presumption and argument that 
Ramakrishna is a Tantric Yogi through and through and therefore all of his spiritual practices and disciplines 
should be looked at from this perspective. 
Given the predilection and emphasis, especially in the West, of the sexual and erotic symbolism and practices 
which fall under the fairly broad and far-reaching heading of Tantra Yoga, and in particular the practices 
which are referred to in the tradition as so-called "left-handed" practices, this type of characterization of 
Ramakrishna's spiritual practices of course serves to bolster and facilitate the Freudian psychoanalytic 
framework which is employed in Kālī's Child and is "projected" (to use a specifically Freudian psychological 
term which is applicable here) upon Ramakrishna himself, despite all evidence to the contrary from virtually 
all of the primary sources that document in painstaking detail the extent and specificities, and ultimate 
results, of the broad range of spiritual practices which Ramakrishna is known to have employed.  
This type of emphasis on Tantra Yoga as the main characteristic of Ramakrishna's spiritual practices as a 
whole, as well as his fairly immature and oversimplified classification of said practices into the so-called "left 
handed" school of Tantra Yoga, of course makes for fairly straightforward psycho-intellectual parallels to be 
drawn between Ramakrishna's spirituality and Freudian psychology - the latter of which is of course arguably 
almost entirely based upon the notion that the primordial motivating and explanatory system of reference 
for human behavior in general is sexual desire - which provides of course the primary psycho-intellectual and 
grounding of Kripal's basic thesis, which again is that it is Ramakrishna's latent and suppressed homoerotic 
desires that were the driving force of much, if not all, of his religious predilection and underpinned many of 
the psychological "states" that he experienced.
But this categorization of Ramakrishna's sādhana as primarily Tantric unfortunately is just simply not 
consistent with the facts and the wide variety of reliable first-hand accounts of his life and teachings and 
accounts of his broad ranging and intense spiritual practices and disciplines that he performed during his so-
called 12 year sādhana phase while residing at Dakshineswar Temple, even in fact in the accounts and 
descriptions contained and related in the biographies authored by the two householder disciples of 
Mahendranath Gupta and Ram Chandra Datta, in Bengali, that Kripal holds in such high regard.  
The perfect and perhaps most poignant counterexample to this gross oversimplification and classification of 
Ramakrishna's theo-philosophical evolutionary process as reflected in his sādhana specifically in Kālī's Child 
as simply "Tantric" (a counterexample that Kripal in fact takes great pains to discount, and for good reason 
his entire argument basically hinges on his ability to discount it in fact ) is the very well documented 
account of Ramakrishna's tutelage under the guidance of Indian ascetic named Totapuri, a wandering monk 
who heralded from, and was by all accounts an adept in, Advaita Vedānta, the non-dualistic school of 
Vedānta which is attributed to Śaṅkara, one of the most famous and influential of all of the Indian 
philosophers throughout India's history. 
According to all accounts, Ramakrishna is said to have practiced under Totapuri for some time, and despite 
some difficulty given his attachment to Kālī as the manifestation of the divine Mother of the universe as his 
personal spiritual guide and teacher, he is said to have fully "realized" the final end goal of Advaita Vedānta, 
after which Totapuri declared as much and then left the Dakshineswar Temple shortly thereafter.
Now despite the fact that both Tantra Yoga and Vedānta stem from the same socio-cultural and theological 
tradition as it were, i.e. as reflected in the Vedas, the Purāṇas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gītā most 
notably, they represent as it were the polar opposite ends of the spectrum from an Indian theo-philosophical 
point of view.  Not only is Tantra Yoga fundamentally dualistic whereas Advaita Vedānta is fundamentally 
non-dualistic at its very core, the two theo-philosophical systems, as is reflected of course in the underlying 
spiritual practices and disciplines that are prescribed in each respective system, could not be further apart.  
Tantra Yoga being life affirming so to speak, and Advaita Vedānta being life-denying to a large extent.  
According to Swami Saradananda account of Ramakrishna's sādhana in fact (an account that again Kripal 
finds all sorts of reasons to discount which rest on very shaky ground at best), he takes great pains to 
emphasize the importance of this non-dual realization that Ramakrishna experienced under the guidance of 
Totapuri, and he describes the related spiritual disciplines and practices under Totapuri - which again fall 
squarely under the orthodox, non-dualistic Indian theo-philosophical system of Advaita Vedānta - as related 
to him by Ramakrishna himself, as the very height, or apex, of the sādhana phase of his life.
While Vedānta and Tantra Yoga as theo-philosophical systems are related, cousins as it were as they do share 
the same parent and do at some level rest on at least very similar theological and socio-cultural foundations, 
both emerging out of the Hindu and Vedic mythological and theological tradition that goes back some four 
thousand years at least and which arguably represents the oldest active and "living" theo-philosophical 
tradition in the world.  It is from and out of this tradition that Ramakrishna emerges, from both a theo-
philosophical as well as socio-cultural perspective.  To a large degree, Ramakrishna is in fact an embodiment 
of sorts, a reflection of the full realization of the mythological, theological and philosophical system of 
Vedānta, and Hinduism proper, which also includes from a socio-cultural perspective, given the rich and 
lasting open religious society of India, Christianity and Islam, faiths and religious systems which he is said to 
have practiced and "realized" alongside of the more classic Indian theo-philosophical traditions of Vedānta, 
Tantra and Bhakti Yoga which of course according to the "insider" tradition he fully realized as well.  
Tantra Yoga is a Sanskrit word which translates into English literally as "loop", "warp" or "weave", generally 
speaking and refers to, from a Indian theo-philosophical perspective  (i.e. as distinct from Buddhist Tantra) a 
set of practices and beliefs that have been more or less integrated and synthesized into Hindu and Vedic 
philosophy and spiritual practices in toto - in particular in the orthodox Indian philosophical systems, i.e. the 
theo-philosophical systems that look to the Vedas as the benchmark of truth and validity - throughout the 
long history of their respective evolution.  
While definitions of Tantra as a specific theo-philosophical system are elusive, it is typically is associated with 
the worship of the primordial female aspect of the divine as manifest in various incarnations and deities (e.g. 
most notably within this particular context with respect to the sādhana of Ramakrishna the goddess Kālī) that 
reflect the very essence of this primordial energy of life itself, i.e. the concept of Śakti or kuṇḍalinī within the 
context of the Indian theo-philosophical tradition as a whole.  As such, Tantra is typically associated with, and 
therefore has developed specific spiritual practices related to, the divine interplay of the basic male and 
female universal principles, referred to in the Tantric corpus and literature as Śiva and Śakti respectively, the 
two collectively forming the very basis of, and source, of the cosmic world-order. 
In this context then, various very specific spiritual disciplines and practices, generally falling under the 
category which in the West has now been termed "mysticism", have evolved which have become associated 
with Tantra that reflect, and in turn in some respects, "reenact" this basic divine interplay such that the 
primordial energy of the goddess can be directly experienced by the spiritual aspirant.  In the tradition 
surrounding Tantra that has evolved in fairly recent times, in the last few hundred years or so, scholars and 
theologians alike have categorized the various practices within Tantra that reflect this divine interplay 
between the primordial male and female forces which underpin the entire cosmic order as either "left 
handed" or "right handed", the former being the term used for the more actively practiced and enacted 
forms of worship, from a physical perspective, of the "union" of Śiva and Śakti as typically exemplified in 
actual sexual intercourse between male and female aspirants that is performed in a very strict ritualistic and 
formalized fashion, supervised by a guru or teacher, that is intended to produce and effect ecstatic states of 
consciousness which ultimately reflect and "reveal" the very nature of these forces themselves. 
Despite the very unique theo-philosophical system that is referred to most commonly in the West now as 
"Tantra Yoga", the system generally speaking is an outgrowth from, and is inherently related to by common 
origins to, basically all of the main - what are referred to as "orthodox" - Indian theo-philosophical traditions 
- i.e. Yoga proper as understood primarily in the tradition surrounding the Yoga Sūtras, Sāṃkhya philosophy 
which forms the basis of much of Yoga's metaphysics and theology, and in turn Vedānta as reflected in the 
Upanishads, the philosophical portion of the Vedas.  What we find in Kālī's Child however, is a narrative that 
traces the fundamental dualistic features of Tantra Yoga, as it relates to the divine interplay between Śiva 
and Śakti, as having originated with Sāṃkhya philosophy, which provides the foundations for Yoga proper as 
it is presented by Patañjali circa 4th century CE.  
In fact though, and this is fundamental to understanding all Indian theo-philosophy, which again in its main or 
"orthodox" branch rests upon the Vedas as its ultimate source and inspiration - Tantra Yoga of course being 
no exception this regard given its heritage and place within the Indo-Aryan mythos and Vedic corpus as a 
whole - this dualism that we find in Sāṃkhya philosophy is a direct derivation and outgrowth of Vedic 
mythos, a much older tradition from Indo-Aryan antiquity where we find this basic male and female cosmic 
interplay reflected in Puruṣa and Prakṛti, Puruṣa being the male aspect of creation, its seed as it were, and 
Prakṛti representing the divine matter upon which Puruṣa acts to bring forth the universe.  
We see then in the very heart and original conception of the Indo-Aryan mythos this male and female, active 
and passive dualism, certainly a fundamental aspect of the Vedas which in turn is fundamental to 
understanding Vedic theo-philosophy which is basically equivalent for all intents and purposes with the 
notion of Indian theo-philosophy, which is the tradition within which Tantra Yoga squarely rests, no matter 
how it is conceived or defined (and there are most definitely different ways and approaches as to how it is 
and has been defined).
The issue here is that such a significant error or misunderstanding, or lack of understanding really, of the 
foundations upon which Tantra Yoga rests and comes out of - a tradition which Ramakrishna didn't just study 
in as some scholar, he literally grew up within the tradition, not even just as a spiritually minded aspirant but 
as a practicing priest no less, a priest in a temple devoted to one of the primordial goddess in Vedic and 
Hindu mythos, i.e. Kālī, one of the primordial goddesses of the Hindu faith, a faith which is again rooted in the 
tradition surrounding the Vedas.  It begs the question really, whether or not Kripal has a true understanding 
of Tantra Yoga in the way that Ramakrishna perceived and understood Tantra Yoga - which arguably he 
didn't even conceive of it at all given that it was so part and parcel to his "religious" beliefs as a whole.  To 
Ramakrishna, his spiritual practices were Vedic and Hindu, this is effectively all he knew.  And he followed 
certain teachers who practiced different variations and flavors of the Vedic/Hindu faith but they all were 
basically to him at least related to the primordial goddess who he worshipped - his divine Mother.  The idea 
that Ramakrishna was primarily a Tantric Yogi would have seemed utterly ridiculous to him no doubt, a 
reflection of the Western mind to try and box him or Religion in general into a corner, a principle which to a 
large extent his entire spiritually life was effectively designed to dispel in fact - all roads leading to the same 
destination as it were.
The point being of course that while it might be convenient to paint Ramakrishna as a Tantric sādhaka in 
order to lock him into a male/female dualistic theological box as it were so that his spiritual practices as 
whole would line up nicely to a Freudian psychoanalysis which is arguably almost entirely based on sex, i.e. 
Kripal's eroticism, is convenient with respect to making his argument and case around Ramakrishna's 
homoeroticism which is the "scandalous secret" which rests in the heart of Kālī's Child, just - like the case 
made for Tantra Yoga's dualism originating in Sāṃkhya philosophy, doesn't hold any water.
Leaving aside the specific heritage and lineage of Tantra Yoga within the Vedic theo-philosophical landscape 
as it were, a landscape and variety of traditions and practices that Ramakrishna espoused whole heartedly in 
a variety of favors and renditions , it is very safe and accurate to describe Tantra Yoga as reflecting the 
underlying belief in the cosmic universal order consisting of the basic interplay and interaction of male and 
female forces that are personified in Śiva and Śakti specifically, deities that were not only pervasive in the 
theological tradition within which Ramakrishna was raised, but pervasive and distinctive in the place where 
Ramakrishna had his most intense years of spiritual and devotional practices and pursuits at the 
Dakshineswar Temple that Ramakrishna, with Kālīof course as the divine Mother being by far the most 
important spiritual and divine presence in his life.  To this extent, Ramakrishna was most certainly a Tantric 
sādhaka.  It is this symbol in fact, where Śakti (as Kālī) is seen as standing on top of Śiva, that Kripal spends a 
great deal of time analyzing and to a large extent provides the psycho-symbolic basis for his argument for 
classifying Ramakrishna's spiritual practices and mindset in toto, as "Tantric" and therefore subject to a 
classically Freudian psychoanalytic lens from within which the source sources of his behavior can be 
understood, or at the very least shed light into, from which his "states of mind" originate from.  
 
Figure 39: Dakshina Kālī, with Śiva devotedly at her feet. 

So while Tantra Yoga does reflect a specific set of disciplines that Ramakrishna practiced - Tantra Yoga in this 
sense again signifying the standard meaning that that term has acquired in modern parlance in the Western 
literature that has developed to describe said specific spiritual practices and disciplines that are associated 
with, and intended to achieve union or realization of, the basic primordial divine female and male energetic 
components that underpin the universal world order - disciplines that were practiced primarily under the 
guidance of the female ascetic Bhairavi Brahmani specifically, and such disciplines are in fact historical and 
theo-philosophically associated with Male/Female divine union and as such are sometimes associated with 
ritualistic sexual intercourse in order to facilitate the full and complete "realization" of such divine interplay, 
such practices are not only extremely uncommon and guarded against for the most part within the more 
standard and orthodox Indian and Hindu religious circles, there in fact is no evidence whatsoever that 
Ramakrishna himself engaged in such "left handed' practices, even within the context of his "Tantric" 
sādhaka specifically.  
The point here is that no matter how one chooses to interpret, categorize or define Ramakrishna's sādhana, 
and in particular in the light of the very significant and almost completely diametrically opposing theo-
philosophical systems as reflected by Vedānta and Tantra Yoga, both of which it is very well documented that 
Ramakrishna practiced and again is said to have fully realized, it is an altogether gross oversimplification to 
categorize his sādhana in toto, and therefore his psycho-analytical framework in general, as fundamentally 
and completely Tantric, even though it is fair to say that that theo-philosophical system in particular did play 
a significant role in his sādhana overall, just one aspect of it thought.  The methods and practices as described 
in the literature surrounding Ramakrishna as it relates to these two "phases" or "aspects" of his sādhana, the 
summit of which is described by Swami Saradananda (and arguably as interpreted by the teachings of Swami 
Vivekananda albeit indirectly), are altogether distinct which is no surprise given the diametrically opposing 
theo-philosophical infrastructure that underpins the two respective belief systems. 
But this however does not imply, and it would be in fact a further misinterpretation or misunderstanding of 
Ramakrishna if in fact one concluded such a thing, that the two teachings do not fundamentally agree with 
each other and complement each other at their most fundamental and essential core, at the very point of 
their ultimate realization as it were.  What Ramakrishna reveals to us in fact, what he shows us and 
demonstrates to us, what his message truly is and how we should "interpret" him - as is the standard 
"insider" view in fact - is that all of the world's religions, and most certainly all of the various Indian theo-
philosophical systems which provided the very foundations of Ramakrishna's spiritual practices and 
disciplines in all of their forms, all ultimately lead to, or result in, the same final "realization" or Truth.

Ultimately, therefore there is not an "insiders" or "outsiders" interpretation of the essential meaning, import 
and relevance of Ramakrishna as perhaps the predominant and most influential religious and spiritual figure 
in the modern era, there is but one true and most relevant, and most accurate and complete interpretation 
of him given all of the evidence at hand when looked at through this most complete, extensive and 
exhaustive theo-philosophical milieu from which he emerges and which he ultimately personifies that is 
represented in fact by the theo-philosophical heritage which succeeds him.  As a further illustration of the 
point regarding the necessity and importance of including the socio-cultural and theo-philosophical context 
within which Ramakrishna lived and practiced his sādhana, through which his various, prolific and arguably 
extreme "states of mind" were in fact "experienced" by him, as a thought experiment of sorts (akin to 
Schrödinger's Cat as it were which was presented as a thought experiment that provided great insights into 
the shortcomings of Quantum Theory) one should consider whether or not it would have been possible for a 
figure such as Ramakrishna to have existed in the West in the 19th century.  
The very simple and stark, rational and logical conclusion that anyone schooled or trained in theology or 
philosophy, or Comparative Religion for that matter, is that it would in fact not have been possible at all.  
That any society in the West confronted with a figure such as Ramakrishna who experienced these so-called 
"catatonic" and "ecstatic" states, i.e. his nirvikalpa samādhi later in his life and his what can only be termed 
"obsessive ad compulsive" behavior as reflected in his worship of the divine as the goddess Kālī which was 
such a hallmark of the sādhana phase of his early adult life, could have only been interpreted in the West as 
at worst psychotic, and at best schizophrenic behavior and as such the poor man would have been in all 
likelihood institutionalized, or as Robert Pirsig was in fact, diagnosed as the effects of a nervous breakdown, 
committed to various psychiatric hospitals, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and "treated" with 
healthy and consistent doses of electroconvulsive therapy on and off for two years.
One of Kripal's insights which is poignant and relevant to this discussion in particular as it relates to the 
fundamental tenets and belief systems that underpin any person in any era in fact, is that Ramakrishna and 
what he became, the avatar of the modern era, an incarnation of God, great sage, whatever you'd like to 
refer to him as was a product not only of his personality, but also the culture and society within which he 
grew up and lived in, namely 19th century Bengal.  Ramakrishna was an illiterate temple priest who interacted 
with some of the most well educated and highest (and lowest) class society of Calcutta, in a time and place 
where West met East in a radical and somewhat oppressive merging of cultures, the so called "Orientalism" 
in action where the indigenous Hindu and Indian culture was subsumed by the leading Western and British 
aristocracy.  And with Ramakrishna's pure and raw language, speaking in the same tongue that Jesus spoke 
essentially - in song and in analogy and metaphor, using parables and stories that the common folk could 
understand and remember quite easily - his message clearly resonated with a lot of people, many of whom 
who traveled long and far to come and spend time with him, to touch his feet as the custom of the Hindus as 
a sign of respect to holy people.
And yet even with the prevalence of Western modes of thought and scientific reason which was the 
benchmark of truth even in 19th century Calcutta, his personality had to be understood and had to be 
reckoned with, and understood and comprehended within the context of the Western cynical mindset.  The 
Hindu, Western trained elite of 19th century Bengali culture could not ignore the strength and purity and 
power of Ramakrishna's personality, this much is evident, and is most certainly reflected by his long-lasting 
and world affecting message that lives on and continues to gain strength in the East and West to this day - 
through the workings of the institutions which bear his name, the Ramakrishna Order which has among other 
things taken great pains to protect and nurture the direct and subsequent interpretations of his life, works 
which are discounts to a large extent or in some cases simply completely ignored in Kālī's Child, the very 
source of this debate.
Let's not forget that Ramakrishna hand-picked both Vivekananda, along with Sarada Devi his wife and 
spiritual partner in fact, as the hall bearers of his message to the world, and as such these two more than any 
others in fact should be looked to as the best source of any "interpretation" of Ramakrishna's life, teachings 
or in general his spiritual disciplines and practices.  Vivekananda, who is best known for recasting and 
revitalizing Vedānta and Yoga in the West, should be the first place to look if one is looking to try and 
understand the true "message" and/or meaning of Ramakrishna, especially from a Western vantage point.  
The three in fact - Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi (aka Holy Mother) and Vivekananda - are worshipped as a triad 
in many of the Vedānta centers that have been established across the world as outposts of the Ramakrishna 
Order in both the East and West, and in this context it is not just Ramakrishna in vacuum that should be 
analyzed to use a Western scientific term, but through and within the context of his relationship to both 
Sarada Devi and Swami Vivekananda as a triumvirate entity, a holy trinity as it were, that the best 
understanding and meaning of Ramakrishna can be revealed.
  
Arguably there is yet another, deeper and more fundamental dimension to the intellectual divide that sites 
between the two sides of the "debate" surrounding the interpretation of Ramakrishna life and teachings as 
one of, if not the, most influential religious and spiritual figure of the modern era.  The lines or boundaries of 
this deeper dimension can in fact be represented along the same basic and fundamental intellectual lines 
upon which this work is basically constructed - one side which is altogether "Western" and is reflected by the 
conclusions drawn in Kālī's Child which posits in a nutshell that Ramakrishna's divine states of ecstasy and 
intense practice of spiritual disciplines stem from, or are the result of, repressed desires and/or deeply 
traumatic experiences that are erotic and sexual in nature (the Tantric and/or Freudian perspective), and the 
other side which is altogether "Eastern" which interprets the life and experiences of Ramakrishna through a 
higher, and more expansive theo-philosophical lens.  
The latter perspective is of course the one which more accurately reflects the perspective of Ramakrishna 
himself, as well as his students and disciples for the most part, and hence the primary reason why this author 
looks at that perspective as the one which is more accurate, or "true".  This "Eastern" perspective looks at 
Ramakrishna not as biological and neuro-chemical behavioral process which is driven by deep seated, 
unconscious emotions and desire, but as the manifestation of a higher order consciousness in human form, 
one that is subject to physical and psychological "laws" as we understand them in the West for the most part, 
but at the same time, given the altogether distinct and unique properties and qualities of this higher form of 
being, or consciousness, is not subject to necessarily, and represents a stark exception to in fact, these basic 
fundamental "natural" laws which we in the West rely on so heavily to explain "phenomena" in all its forms - 
both physical and in this case psychological.
As expounded upon and proffered up throughout much of this work, this theo-philosophical and/or 
intellectual divide between the East and West is a very real phenomenon upon which the source of this 
debate ultimately hinges upon.  From the Western perspective, reality is characteristically defined in 
objective and scientific terms - science in this sense being defined as that which can be proven via 
experiment and can therefore be held to be verifiable "true".  This view of the world, which is of course the 
predominant view in academic circles, is fundamentally mechanistic and causally deterministic, and therefore 
ultimately is atheistic (or naturalistic).  Knowledge in fact is bound by these assumptions in the West whether 
this is recognized or not, and these assumptions are most certainly reflected in the "Western" interpretation 
of Ramakrishna as reflected in Kālī's Child.  For the bulk of the theoretical and rational underpinnings of this 
work rest squarely upon Freudian psychological theory, a model of the mind that is a direct product of, and is 
intimately related to, the Western mechanistic and causally deterministic framework that characterizes 
science as a whole, providing the underlying intellectual framework - and its related assumptions be they 
specifically called out as such or not -  for the interpretation of Ramakrishna, and in particular the 
interpretation of his spiritual practices, practices which are viewed primarily (and inadequately to a large 
degree) through the erotic and sensual lens of Tantra Yoga,which of course lends itself quite nicely to 
Freudian psychoanalysis. 
The "Eastern" view however, takes a much more holistic and "energy" based perspective, one which is not 
fundamentally mechanistic in any way really, and one which from a knowledge perspective, epistemologically 
speaking, includes and incorporates supraconscious experience and related states of consciousness that fall 
outside of Freudian psychological theory.  The Eastern worldview, as reflected in its theo-philosophical 
tradition as a whole, integrates religious experience as we define it in the West into their ontological 
framework directly, i.e. their conception of reality.  Therefore their perspective, in particular with respect to 
the interpretation of influential and powerful religious figures like Ramakrishna, is not constrained by the 
intellectual shortcomings that are inherent to so-called subject-object metaphysics, i.e. a mechanistic and 
objective realist conception of the world which frames experience and reality in terms of objects, 
measurements, and cause and effect relations.   
From the Eastern vantage point then, and this is a very important point with regards to the distinction 
between its perspective versus the Western perspective, Ramakrishna's states of consciousness are not only 
"real", they in fact reflect a state of being, or existence, which is ontologically more significant than, or prior 
to conceptually speaking, and therefore more fundamental than the reality of the physical and/or mental 
world as it is conceived of in the West and which ultimately provides the intellectual boundaries for 
understanding the types of experiences that he "embodies" and wholly manifests.  Given this more broad 
and inclusive ontological framework then, the Eastern vantage point does not require any specific theoretical 
mental or cognitive scientific framework outside of the classical Indian theo-philosophical systems 
themselves which all include, and in fact help to define, the spiritual practices and experiences of 
Ramakrishna.  
It is the mapping of the Eastern theo-philosophical systems into Western intellectual constructs that is the 
very source of the problem as it were when trying to understand the source of the two wholly distinctive and 
unique perspectives, i.e. interpretations, of Ramakrishna as a spiritual being as it were.  Spirituality in fact, 
from a Western vantage point, has no place in science, which as it turns out is a big problem when trying to 
understand a pure and unadulterated spiritual being like Ramakrishna for example.  This again is the square 
peg in the round hold problem in a nutshell.
At the heart of this distinction then, is the very nature of reality itself, and in turn what laws, or "lens", should 
be applied to any such being, or organism, that is a manifestation of said reality.  But the basic premise here 
which is altogether "Eastern" from a theo-philosophical standpoint, and one that is lost to a large extent in 
the literature surrounding the interpretation of Ramakrishna that has emerged in the last few years, is that 
there does in fact exist a higher form of "consciousness", i.e. supraconsciousness, and that it is in fact a very 
"real" phenomena, albeit a phenomena that defies description in the Western sense of the term  or perhaps 
more accurately put is that when these types of phenomena are described in Western intellectual 
terminology and frameworks, we end up with a wholly disfigured and disemboweled view of that which we 
are intending to study and analyze.  This is essentially the source, and proper description really, of the 
contents of Kālī's Child, despite the fact that it remains a sound and well thought out and well researched 
piece of scholarship.  
As such we are left with a great divide as it were, and one which has plagued the intellectual landscape of 
man since civilization has emerged some 3000 years ago, and one that arguably created the divide between 
Plato and his student Aristotle, the ontological debate between the two which on one side was altogether 
idealistic, i.e. Plato of course, and on the other side was altogether hylomorphic, i.e. where reality was 
defined as the combination of substance as well as  form, and where - importantly - form in and of itself was 
no longer held to be "real".  It is with Aristotle's conception of substantial form that we in the West were 
provided with the basis of not only our entire logical and rational framework in and of itself (i.e. dialectic 
which is sourced from the Organon, the standard title of Aristotle's six basic works on logic and reason, but 
also from which the very initial boundaries of the Western mind, i.e. Science, are drawn.  
This is the very problem that Kant tried to solve in fact, fully described in his theo-philosophical system that 
he claimed to be entirely constructed and built upon reason itself, and one which came to known as 
transcendental idealism which he developed to try and bridge this very divide to a large extent, one which in 
his day was reflected most prominently by the divide between Religion and Science that had developed as a 
direct result of the developments and innovations of the Scientific Revolution that were underpinned by 
what is referred to in Western philosophical and intellectual circles as (strict) rational empiricism.  
So this is not a new problem by any stretch of the imagination, but it is one that continues to persist and 
plague us - in the West at least - and one which sits at the very root as it were of the problem of trying to 
understand or comprehend Ramakrishna within any sort of classically defines Western intellectual 
framework which as outlines above comes along with a variety of implicit assumptions that make it an 
altogether inadequate, and arguably inappropriate, means to understand any sort of "mystic" experience and 
as such provides the very impetus for a good portion of this work which attempts to expand the definition of 
knowledge in the West to incorporate such experiences - back to first philosophy to use the classical English 
translation of Aristotle's terminology.  In many respects, Paramhamsa Ramakrishna, as well as his spiritual 
successor Swami Vivekananda, the founder and expositor of the very intellectual (and inherently mystical) 
tradition within which the author was specifically trained, very much embody the knowledge which sits 
squarely outside of the Western intellectual framework - the so-called citadel of science - which is the very 
framework that is used of course used throughout Kālī's Child (mostly Freudian psychology).

Let us start with an analysis of the meaning of and significance of Ramakrishna, most often referred to as 
Paramhamsa Ramakrishna in the literature surrounding and within the religious movement and theo-
philosophical tradition which he inspired that was implemented and constructed for the most part by his 
spiritual successor Swami Vivekananda with the founding of the Ramakrishna Order at the end of the 19th 
century some 1 years after Ramakrishna's passing.  First it is important to understand that in almost all 
Eastern theo-philosophical traditions, consistent with the idea of "spiritual rebirth" and baptism with the 
Christian theo-philosophical tradition, it is customary to have one's name changed once they enter spiritual 
life as an aspirant, what's called a sādhaka in Hindu and Vedic terminology.  In this context, at some point 
during Ramakrishna's spiritual practices sādhana, his "reborn" "spiritual" name was given to him (it's not 
altogether clear precisely when or by whom the name was given to him in fact) and he was referred to from 
then on not by his given birth name, i.e. Gadadhar Chatterji, but by his given, received, spiritual name, i.e. 
Ramakrishna.  
The name of course carries with it great symbolic and mythological significance within the socio-cultural and 
mythological milieu and society within which Ramakrishna lived, i.e. northern India - Rāma being the central 
figure of the great Hindu epic the Ramayana of course, and Krishna is of course the great seer or prophet, i.e. 
avatar, of the Mahābhārata, who plays a central role of course in not just the Bhagavad Gītā, or Song of the 
Lord, but also within the context of Vedānta philosophy as a whole of which the this text is one of the three 
canonical scriptures that underpin the theo-philosophical system (the Brahmā Sūtras and Upanishads being 
the other two).  The given spiritual name Ramakrishna of course symbolizes and implies that Ramakrishna is 
an embodiment, or even more literally interpreted as, the reincarnation of both of the great figures of Hindu 
mythological lore and both of which were considered to be "avatars", or manifestations of God, or Viṣṇu, in 
human form. 
Furthermore, let us also review and understand the meaning of the epithet Paramhamsa which is many 
times used in conjunction with Ramakrishna as a sign of respect and status from a spiritual perspective within 
the Hindu and Indian socio-cultural and theological tradition.  Paramhamsa is a composite Sanskrit word 
consisting of the root parama which means 'supreme' or 'transcendent' combined with the Sanskrit word 
hamsa which means 'swan" or "wild goose".  While the goose in Western mythological lore signifies silliness 
or foolishness, In Hindu cultural and mythological lore, wild geese, including swans, are noted for 
characteristics such as discipline, stamina, grace, and beauty.  This is especially true of the "bar-headed 
goose" (Anser Indicus), whose migratory route from Central Asia to India and back forces it to fly over the 
Himalayas twice a year, a feat which makes it one of the highest flying birds in the world. 
In the Vedas and the Purāṇas, hamsa is a symbol for the Soul and is depicted as the "mount" or "vehicle" 
(vahana), the mount or vehicle, of the god Brahmā.  It is also believed to be the only creature that is capable 
of separating milk from water once they have been mixed, which symbolically represents the ability of the 
Supreme Indian sage, i.e. the Paramhamsa, to discriminate between the "real" and the "unreal" which is one 
of the primary and principle characteristics and qualities of a Vedic sage, in particular as reflected in the non-
dual tradition of Advaita Vedānta as described by Śaṅkara where this type of discrimination is held to be the 
highest form of knowledge and the ultimate source of liberation, or mokṣa.  The swan then, or hamsa, is a 
metaphor for the spiritually advanced adept who is capable of such discrimination. 
The epithet Paramhamsa therefore is typically applied and prepended to Ramakrishna as a sign of respect 
and admiration with respect to his stature within the Hindu theological and religious tradition as a whole, and 
is an epithet that in fact is used throughout the Hindu religious community as a sign of respect and 
admiration for a variety of spiritual leaders and adepts.  Paramhamsa in Sanskrit means "supreme swan", and 
it implies and signifies from a Hindu and Vedic symbolic perspective that Ramakrishna is a akin to a great 
swan, the creature that is looked upon as one who bridges, or lives, in two distinct and yet related worlds - in 
the case of the swan it is both in the air and on water and in the case of a "Paramhamsa", like Ramakrishna, it 
signifies that they live both in the physical world as well as the spiritual world and that they are able to move 
freely, just as the swan, in both.
Arguably at the very center of this dimension of varying perspectives, again "Western" versus "Eastern", is 
what to make of, and how in turn to interpret and comprehend the significance and import of the type of 
figure that Ramakrishna represents, a representation that is arguably very much embedded and 
encapsulated in the epithet that is is most commonly used along with his given spiritual name, i.e. 
Paramhamsa, or simply Paramhamsa Ramakrishna.  This name, its derivation and etymology, from a 
Hindu/Indian theo-philosophical tradition from which Gadadhar Chatterji as an actual historical figure, or 
persona, emerges not only carries with it a wealth of theological and mythological significance (Rāma and 
Krishna), but also embeds within it, and therefore signifies Ramakrishna' attainment thereof, the penultimate 
notion or concept of the entire orthodox Indian theo-philosophical tradition within which Ramakrishna's 
spiritual life (which is basically his entire life according to almost all of the biographical sources we have 
available on him) is played out (Paramhamsa).
Once we start with this seemingly obvious but at the same time very relevant and important fact, we realize 
right at the outset that there is no way to translate his very name, i.e. Paramhamsa Ramakrishna, into English 
and/or within the Western theo-philosophical framework that is used to interpret his life in Kālī's Child.  
What we can do however, is to keep to the basic transliteration of the name itself, and let it to a large extent 
speak for itself - once we have established the basic grounds and significance behind the specific words that 
are combined to formulate his name that is.  This is but a small example, but at the same time is reflective of 
the very nature and scope of the problem at hand, namely how to "translate" Ramakrishna into a Western 
intellectual framework, one that in fact is fundamentally bereft of any theology as that has been almost 
entirely stripped away since the so-called Enlightenment Era when religion and science were fundamentally 
split apart as a direct result of the rise of empiricism and objective realism.
Keeping this in mind then, let us now proceed to look at the terminology that is used to describe the various 
ecstatic states that Ramakrishna is known to have experienced consistently and quite powerfully and 
intensely throughout the full duration of his life really, although they became more intense during his later 
more mature years of course.  For it is perhaps in the very translation of these states of experience, or 
consciousness, into Western language and theoretical models, i.e. Freudian psychology primarily, that we 
encounter arguably the most difficult of challenges when trying to interpret Ramakrishna in the West.  The 
literature surrounding Ramakrishna is abound with the very specific Indian philosophical Sanskrit compound 
term nirvikalpa samādhi which is consistently used, even in English translation in fact, to describe 
Ramakrishna's state of divine ecstasy - a state of "being" or consciousness to use a somewhat circular 
definition, that is described as superconscious in Interpreting Ramakrishna, Kālī's Child Revisited, no doubt in 
order to attempt to place nirvikalpa samādhi as s psychological phenomena somewhere within, or at least 
relative to, the standard view of mind as offered up by Freud which underpins the Western interpretation of 
Ramakrishna which is presented in Kālī's Child.
Kālī's Child argues that these ecstatic states are in fact due to, from a Freudian psychological perspective, 
repressed homoerotic desires of Ramakrishna and/or as a result of traumatic sexual experiences that he 
endured, in particular as reflected in the very long and persistent state that he was in after the culmination of 
his studies with the Advaita Vedānta teacher Totapuri toward the end of the so-called sādhana, or practice of 
spiritual disciplines, phase of his life.  As such, given the intellectual psychological framework that is used to 
describe and explain said "behavior" or "states of consciousness", any sort of acausal, intuitive, or even 
synchronous (using that term in a Jungian sense) origin of said experiences is entirely ruled out and not even 
considered a possibility.  In other words the underlying assumptions of the intellectual framework that is 
used to try and explain or understand said behavior requires not only that there be some sort of "cause" or 
reason behind said experience, which in this case is described or couched in psychological terms (the psyche 
being viewed as a natural, mechanistic bio-chemical and neurological stimulus- response, desire driven 
entity), but that the actual states of "consciousness" that Ramakrishna reflects and/or experiences be 
defined within said framework.  The problem fundamentally here is that not only do these states not exist 
within the Freudian theoretical framework - he simply provides the conscious and the unconscious as the 
possible sources of behavioral response - but any sort of acausal, or non-natural source as it were of said 
phenomena is not even considered within the framework itself.  Causal determinism underpins the entire 
model, and of course this is definitely not the case with most, if not all Eastern theo-philosophical 
frameworks, within which Ramakrishna clearly stands and represents no matter what intellectual paradigms 
or tools one uses to try and understand him.
The Eastern vantage point then, the other side of the argument as it were, not only assumes that these states 
of "higher" consciousness do in fact exist, but that in turn no sort of cause or behavioral mechanism need be 
provided to explain their existence, i.e. in no way are any sort of trauma or any type of repression or 
suppression required to explain said phenomena.  The phenomena simply exist, and exist as an integral and 
in fact primordial characteristic of reality, or being itself.  And from time to time, these states manifest 
themselves within the human form, and in particular, as evidenced throughout history, seem to coalesce and 
be associated with specific persona in a very fundamental, persistent and powerful way.  This is the Eastern 
(Hindu really) avatar, or divine incarnation doctrine in a nutshell.  But note that by definition, these beings 
exist outside of the realm of existence that is governed by causality.  This is an important point.  The Eastern 
worldview does not deny physical reality, and does not deny the notion of cause and effect which governs it 
(take the law of karma for example) it just provides for an exception to this reality, a higher ground of 
existence or being as it were that is not subject to these laws as it rests "above" them, which is the typical 
Western mode of thinking about such matters as it relates to "spiritual ascent" but a better way to put it is 
perhaps that these beings are inherent to, or are wholly integrated with, this higher order reality itself and 
therefore while their physical forms are bound by these laws of cause and effect, as is all physical reality, 
their spiritual forms, which to them represents their core being, their very fundamental aspect of their 
existence and reality, are bound to no such laws.  
This is illustrated in the Buddhist conception of nirvana as well as the Indian theo-philosophical term mokṣa, 
both of which are of Indian origin in fact.  These end states are defined more or less as the absence of, or the 
complete cessation of, subjugation to the laws that bind an individual soul, a persona, to the world, i.e. what 
is referred to in the Buddhist tradition as the endless round of birth and death, the wheel of dharma, etc.  So 
in the Eastern worldview, there is an exception built into the intellectual and theological landscape itself that 
allows for beings like Ramakrishna to be understood and comprehended, from within a complete cohesive 
and coherent theo-philosophical infrastructure as it were, something that is altogether missing and absent 
from Western thought.  At the root of this misconception of the so-called "Western" perspective then is the 
attempt at providing not only an intellectual foundation for, but also a "psychological" basis for (which is an 
altogether Western intellectual construct in and of itself) samādhi as a psychological phenomenon.  What 
results unfortunately, given the limited capacity of the intellectual framework that is used is at best a 
misunderstanding of the concept within the Indian theo-philosophical landscape within which Ramakrishna 
as an historical and religious figure emerges and within which he studied and practiced his spiritual disciples, 
and at worst represents a complete Western and Freudian bastardization (excuse the strong language) of the 
term itself and as such the true meaning and import, and of course ultimately the "interpretation" of the 
manifestation of said sates within the historical figure Ramakrishna, is lost.
Samādhi is of course the very specific Indian theo-philosophical Sanskrit term, which again is used in almost 
all the literature surrounding Ramakrishna to describe his almost constant "state of mind" and absorption in 
divine consciousness, or the Supreme Self, or alternatively what is described in the Upanishads as 
Satcitānanda, or Existence-Knowledge-Bliss-Absolute.  Samādhi however does carry with it a very specific and 
uniquely Indian theo-philosophical definition however, one which is defined specifically within the context of 
the system of Yoga as it is described in the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali, which is the origin of the Sanskrit word 
and term in fact and therefore the context from within which it is to be best, or most appropriately, 
understood.  In Yoga, samādhi is the state of "being" or "awareness" which is perhaps best described in 
Western nomenclature as the most pure and unadulterated state of contemplation of the divine where the 
distinction between the individual, or jiva, and the object of contemplation, i.e. Īśvara or God, completely 
dissolves in fact.  Where the two become one, and the subject and object merge into a single "experience".  
The more technical terminology that is used in the "Eastern", or Indian theo-philosophical literature it 
describe Ramakrishna's state of mind during what is often described as his almost constant states of "divine 
intoxication" that are characterized by an almost complete cessation of physical motor function or skills as 
well as a complete lack of perception or awareness of his "physical surroundings", is in fact actually nirvikalpa 
samādhi.  Nirvikalpa is a Sanskrit word (adjective in this case) that means something along the lines of "not 
admitting an alternative", and which therefore, when applied to the very specific Indian theo-philosophical 
term samādhi as defined within the orthodox Indian philosophical school of Yoga as described by the 3rd/4th 
century sage Patañjali (which is then recast and re-interpreted for the West by Vivekananda in the late 19th 
century as Raja Yoga, or Royal Yoga), implies an even higher or more concentrated variant of samādhi proper 
than that which is described in the eighth limb of Patañjali's eight limbed system of Yoga.  
In Yoga, as described by Patañjali specifically, samādhi is the final, i.e. the eighth, of the eight limbs of his 
entire theo-philosophical system.  While the eighth limb is typically perceived from a Western perspective as 
the final, or end goal, of the entire system itself, the author argues elsewhere in this work that this 
interpretation of samādhi within the context of Indian philosophy as a whole represents a basic 
misunderstanding or misconception of its place within the entire, eight limbed system itself - i.e. another 
example of the misuse of a Western intellectual framework, in this case one which is based upon motivation, 
goals and is fundamentally linear and progressive, upon a foreign theo-philosophical system which at its core 
is essentially cyclical, emergent and codependent.  While Dr. Kripal never states this specifically, that he 
doubts that these states are achievable without some sort of trauma that sits behind them, this conclusion 
does nonetheless follow as a byproduct of his arguments and underlying theoretical frameworks that he 
uses.  But the problem here is, and Interpreting Ramakrishna, Kālī's Child Revisited covers this at some length, 
Freud does not recognize anything other than the conscious or the unconscious mind and therefore within 
this intellectual framework there is no room for any so-called superconscious experience.  Kālī's Child does 
not recognize or address this point in any way, which is unfortunately a major flaw of the work, and as does 
not provide any intellectual framework for describing anything that resembles the states of mind that the 
East consider extraordinarily relevant and real.  And yet this is the entire world that Ramakrishna lived in 
from a child from the classically "Eastern" vantage point rests upon the fundamental assertion of not just the 
existence of such experiences, their elemental reality, but also that the reality which they represent is in fact 
more true, or more real, that the world of name and form which for the most part is representative of the 
entire worldview of the West.
Kripal clearly approaches the validity of these states of mind with what can be best described as a healthy 
degree of skepticism, hence his subjugation of these prototypical Eastern, "mystical" states within a 
classically Western psychological framework, the only "accepted" intellectual framework in fact that exists in 
the Western academic and scholarly tradition to describe these so-called "higher states" of mind that are 
fundamental characteristics of Eastern theo-philosophy in general.  The "Eastern" vantagepoint then, and this 
is not made altogether clear in Interpreting Ramakrishna, Kālī's Child Revisited, is that in fact these higher 
states of consciousness and/or reality do in fact exist, and furthermore their existence is not predicated or 
dependent in any way upon any sort of traumatic psychological experience, sexually induced or otherwise.  In 
fact, from an Eastern theo-philosophical perspective, as expressed in various schools of Buddhism as well as 
orthodox Indian philosophical systems such as Vedānta, Yoga and Tantra (all of which were practiced and 
followed by Ramakrishna during his sādhana), these experiences, this "higher" reality, is in fact considered to 
be more real, more ontologically significant and "prior" as it were, than the day to day mental and 
materialistic existence mankind which not only fundamentally bounds the psychological intellectual 
framework within which Kripal attempts to explain Ramakrishna's "behavior" and "state of mind", but also 
within which the entire intellectual system of knowledge itself is bound - hence again the square peg in a 
round hole problem. 

So we are led quite naturally back to the basic assumption and intellectual bounds of Science, i.e. what Pirsig 
refers to as the citadel of science and is reflected in what he calls most poignantly subject-object metaphysics 
which perhaps could provide us with at least a better intellectual and/or metaphysical framework from 
within which we can bridge this divide between Western and Eastern perspectives on the interpretation of 
Paramhamsa Ramakrishna and what to make of his constant state of intense divine intoxication.  As the 
author does, Pirsig attacks the very foundations of subject-object metaphysic as a wholly inadequate 
intellectual, philosophical and metaphysical framework for describing reality in all its component parts as it a) 
does not provide any sort of validity to what he calls the "direct intuitive experience" from which are sourced 
hypotheses themselves, the very pillar of modern empirical scientific inquiry in fact, and b) it does not 
incorporate or integrate, or even acknowledge the reality of Ideas in and of themselves, in a very Platonic 
sense, i.e. concepts such as beauty, quality, or virtue for example, all of which are used and leveraged by the 
so-called citadel of science to determine not only which divined hypotheses should be pursued by the 
scientist, but also in turn by the scientific community at large to determine which possible theories are the 
"best" ones.  This very conundrum or paradox is in fact crystalized and articulated perhaps best in the 
concept of Ockham's razor, coined by the English Franciscan scholar and theologian from the 14th century 
which arguably provided at least to some extent the rational and theoretical impetus for scientific 
advancement since the Enlightenment Era.  
In this context, as outlined in Pirsig's seminal work on the subject which is somewhat misleading titled Zen 
and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Pirsig proposes that subject-object metaphysics as a metaphysical 
paradigm of reality is in fact the root of the problem of the overly materialistic and mechanistic worldview of 
the West which as a paradigm of thought not only alienates individuals from "things" or "objects" in and of 
themselves, but also in turn alienates individuals from each other and in turn entire societies and cultures 
from each other as "alien" entities which exist "outside" themselves.  
As such, he formulates an alternative and more comprehensive system of metaphysics which directly 
incorporates the reality of ideas (again in a Platonic sense of the term such as Beauty or virtue "intuitive" 
experience, as well as), intellectual constructs which underpin the notion of Ockham's razor which has more 
or less provided us in the West with the rational, albeit heuristic, model for determining the inherent "value" 
of scientific theories in general.  Scientific theories in fact continue to be measured and/or evaluated by this 
albeit somewhat heuristic, and arguably Platonic, notion as expressed as Ockham's razor, where theories are 
evaluated and adopted by the scientific community at large not just by their predictive modeling power with 
respect to "natural phenomena", i.e. "physical reality", but also by their inherent "simplicity" and/or 
"elegance", attributes which are in and of themselves ethereal and resist measurement in any classical 
scientific way and in effect reflect, whether explicit or not, the fundamental belief in the reality and power of 
(Platonic) ideas as foundational principles for the so-called citadel of science.  
Pirsig then goes on to present what he refers to as the Metaphysics of Quality which not only incorporates 
the intuitive experience from which hypotheses themselves originate from, but also in turn as a byproduct 
thereof the "mystical" experience of prophets and sages throughout the ages as well which in effect are of 
the same character, and originate from the same "experience" as that which drives scientific empirical 
inquiry itself.   Within the context of Pirsig's Metaphysic of Quality, and to borrow some of the very 
powerful language he uses to sum up and describe the basic limitations of classically Western materialistic 
objective realism - which he again refers to from a philosophical and metaphysical perspective as subject-
object metaphysics - Ramakrishna represents the Platypus , i.e. the class of being or organism which does 
not fit into the pre-existing intellectual and scientific framework that has been designed to describe the 
psychology of modern man, i.e. Freudian psychology.   For it is through the lens of Freudian psychology that 
in fact virtually the entire assessment and analysis of Ramakrishna's "behavior" as "Tantric" rests in Kālī's 
Child.
From the introductory chapter on the "Hindu Unconscious", despite the fact that Freudian psychology is not 
presented as a "theory" of mind as such, albeit the most widely accepted theory of mind in the West from a 
modern academic and scholarly perspective but a theory nonetheless, and one that while proves useful in 
many contexts (for example in psychoanalysis which has become so prevalent in the West in the modern 
era), it represents a theory nonetheless, and one that sits in stark contrast to Jungian psychology in fact, a 
fact and an alternative theory of mind that is not addressed at all in Kālī's Child despite its inherent 
capabilities, given its altogether Idealist and arguably characteristically "Eastern" perspective, to better 
comprehend the experiences which Ramakrishna and those who came in direct contact with him describe, as 
well as the overarching and classically Indian and Hindu (and as such "Eastern") socio-cultural and theo-
philosophical context within which Ramakrishna exists as a "cognitive" and "psychological" being. 
From one of Kripal's introductory Chapters in Kālī's Child, entitled "The Hindu Unconscious", one which no 
doubt was significantly revised and/or edited upon the second edition of the work in response to the wide 
ranging criticism with which the initial publication of the work received, while we find Kripal reluctant to 
apply Freudian psychology as applicable to Hindu theo-philosophy and society as a whole, we do find a clear 
exposition of Kripal's assumptions regarding the verity and objective validity of Freudian psychology as it 
applies to human behavior in general, and of course in turn to Ramakrishna specifically:

I can only say that I place myself somewhere in the middle, holding neither to a rigid Freudianism nor to a 
radical relativism.  Put simply, I believe that the human mind possesses certain characteristics - a common 
biological base, a symbolizing function, defense and censoring strategies such as repression, displacement, and 
projection, a tendency to imagine in the language of the body and its shapes, and so forth - that give its 
functioning a certain universal character.  This basic psychic or biological unity, however, is profoundly 
differentiated by such cultural forms as child-rearing practices, social organization, and religious doctrines, all 
of which differ radically from culture to culture.  Human psychology, then, is relatively consistent across 
cultures.  If it were not, such disciplines as anthropology and the history of religions would be impossible.  But 
human psychology is also variable, and radically so.  If it were not, anthropology and the history of religions 
might be possible, but they would also be unnecessary, not to mention uninteresting.  Within this via media, I 
would assert that psychoanalysis, despite its birth in Western culture, can be used to interpret non-Western 
cultures, but I would add immediately, following the pioneering work of Stanley Kurtz, that it first must be 
"reshaped" to fit each and every cultural context in which it is applied. 

So while at some level credit must be given for at least the statement of position regarding the psychological 
assumptions upon which the arguments and analysis regarding Ramakrishna are based in Kālī's Child, and 
despite his admitting to some sort of relative casting as it were to Freudian psychology to fit the underlying 
socio-cultural and theological intellectual framework within which Ramakrishna lived and studied, that which 
formed the basic psychological imprint of his "mind" as it were, he does admit to any other psychological 
theoretical framework other than Freudian as a possible valid theory of mind, despite again his willingness to 
"relax" what he refers to as "rigid Freudianism".  However, if the presumption of the mind and psyche as a 
bio-chemical and mechanistic process which drives overall human behavior, behavior which is described in 
terms of a causal based psycho-analytic framework which is characterized by "defense and censoring 
strategies such as repression, displacement, and projection" is not rigid Freudianism then what is rigid 
Freudianism?
In brief, Freudian psychology rests primarily on the same mechanistic and deterministic assumptions as 
Western science, hence its adoption in the academic and scholarly community in the West as the standard 
bearing psychological framework.  It works under the assumption that the mind of man is inherently a desire 
driven system, and as a biological organism it has evolved into its current "state" as the process of evolution 
and natural selection as put forth by Darwin and as such it is best understood through a fully deterministic 
and mechanistic vantage point taking evolutionary and genetic factors into account, as well as an 
understanding of the basic bio-chemical and neurological systems processing framework which underpins 
"man" as an animated thinking and living organism.  Freudian psychology in fact rests squarely upon the 
same basic principles as empiricism and objective realism and as such should be considered to be a 
counterpart to classical "Western" scientific inquiry within as it pertains to the mental faculty of man and as a 
tool for describing the nature and origins and source of human behavior, in all its forms. 
In this context then, and despite the fact that it is not explicitly called out as such in Kālī's Child, the validity 
and universal application of Freudian psychology as a framework for explaining human behavior of all kinds 
rests at the very heart, again not surprisingly, his entire argument, not to mention at the heart of modern 
psychiatric practice which is an altogether Western invention in fact.  However, it is very relevant and 
important to point out that Kripal takes this assumption, despite the fact that he attempts to "loosen" it 
somewhat, as an a priori scientifically proven and empirically verified fact regarding human behavioral 
analysis, not even questioning as it were whether or not Freudian psychology as an intellectual theory a) has 
any limitations per se outside of the social and cultural nuances that he points out (but then arguably 
altogether ignores when he comes to his grand conclusions regarding the source and nature of Ramakrishna's 
"behavior" as it is cast in a very classically Freudian intellectual framework by any stretch of the imagination), 
or b) whether or not there are any alternatives psychological frameworks which are better suited to explain 
not just Ramakrishna as a deeply religious man, regardless of culturally background, but whether or not 
alternative psychological frameworks exist to explain the "Eastern" mindset in general.
This assumption in fact, or this lack of perspective perhaps better put, is not just a defect of Kālī's Child 
however, it's a defect of the entire Western intellectual framework, as pointed out by Robert Pirsig among 
others over the last century or so, and is of course one of the major theses that underlies this work.  The 
entire Western academic structure, the very core of Science as we understand it in the post Enlightenment 
Era in fact, has led us to a place where we cannot, if we are to be taken seriously from within the academic 
and scientific community itself, challenge some of the basic assumptions upon which this so-called citadel of 
science is constructed.  

But there is also an arguably more dangerous and deeper undercurrent of racism and/or "culturism" at work 
here within the context of the debate on how to "interpret" Ramakrishna's life and teachings as a whole as 
well, and this needs to be called out as such.  We live in a world for better or worse that continues to be 
prejudiced toward Western civilization and Western modes of thought, in particular as it relates to more 
ancient, typically considered to be "less civilized" modes of thinking.  19th century Bengal is in fact a reflection 
of those very same forces at work, forces which at some level were elemental in producing not just 
Ramakrishna as a religious figure, but even more so producing and providing the impetus for the work of 
Ramakrishna's foremost disciple, i.e. Swami Vivekananda who is given credit for not just bringing Yoga to the 
West but also for revitalizing Hinduism and Indian nationalism in general.
In 19th century Bengal, British culture was being super-imposed onto Hindu and Indian culture in a very direct 
and somewhat oppressive manner, what is referred to in the academic and scholarly literature nowadays as 
one of the effects or manifestation of "colonization", which in many respects has been a hallmark of Western 
civilization in the modern era (from which the United States of course ultimate revolted against) as 
exemplified by the complete destruction of Native American culture by the Americans (and French and 
Spanish of course).  In the historical record in fact over the last few hundred years, even after the so-called 
Enlightenment Era, we can find many examples of this cultural superimposition of Western civilization upon a 
variety of native cultures and civilizations, not just in India in the 19th century but throughout the Middle East 
and of course in Africa as well which was also subject to European "colonization" for centuries.  The effect of 
this colonization by the West throughout the globe for the past few centuries has been at best a watering 
down of many indigenous host culture and societies, and at worst resulted in direct suppression, or even in 
some cases the outright annihilation, of many indigenous peoples, cultures and societies.  As a justification of 
this "colonization" of course, the host cultures and societies which were being subjugated were looked down 
upon as backwards, ancient and outdated, fundamentally flawed and archaic.  
Unfortunately, Kālī's Child fits right squarely into this category of work.  By taking Freudian psychology as a 
more accurate and telling vantage point of Ramakrishna's life and teachings, than say Yoga or Vedānta for 
example, Kripal is applying this very same Western paradigm of intellectual superiority over, specifically in his 
case, the Indian theo-philosophical tradition from which Ramakrishna himself emerged - a theo-philosophical 
tradition which rests within one of the longest lasting and most influential religious systems of the world, i.e. 
Hinduism, from which Vedānta, Yoga and Tantra Yoga are ultimately rooted, all of which were actively 
practiced and synthesized psycho-intellectually by Ramakrishna himself.  This latter point is not only manifest 
in the Freudian psychoanalytical lens which is prominently figured in the interpretation of Ramakrishna in 
Kālī's Child  and by which of course the the rational argument is made for the emphasis of Ramakrishna's 
Tantric sādhana over his non-dual "Vedic" spiritual practices, or even his practice Bhakti Yoga, or devotional 
practices, which arguably underscores virtually his entire spiritual life.
Having said that however, there does in fact exist an alternative psychological framework from within which 
we have a much better chance and opportunity to understand Ramakrishna from, i.e. Jungian psychology.  
For Jung offered, in the early part of the twentieth century, in fact as a direct reaction to and as an 
alternative to Freud's mechanistic and process based, desire driven, model of the psyche, a comprehensive 
set of psychological principles, tenets and theories which fundamentally admit to the existence of not just the 
notion of the existence of an all pervading "consciousness" (akin to the Sāṃkhya philosophical notion of 
Puruṣa), i.e. Jung's collective unconscious, but also the description of methods, processes and mental 
constructs which facilitate and describe this so-called "spiritual ascent" which arguably best describes the 
very nature, and according to him at least as well as his followers, the basic and fundamental underlying 
purpose of Ramakrishna's entire life and teaching.
We refer here to the Jungian concepts of the collective unconscious, the existence of archetypes within the 
collective unconscious framework which manifest in the individual psyche, as well as the process of what Jung 
termed individuation, which leverages these archetypes, along with a uniquely Jungian methodology which 
he refers to as active imagination (a form of visualization which has direct counterparts to Tantra Yoga  
practices in fact, i.e. mandalas) which is meant to be used to facilitate the process of individuation and in turn 
lead to a more tranquil and harmonious psychological state of mind so to speak.  While at first glance Jung's 
principle of individuation appears at some level to correspond to Eastern spiritual practices of ascent into 
"higher" stages of consciousness, the principle nonetheless sits apart from classical Eastern theo-
philosophical systems.  In fact, Jung has been known to recommend against the practice of meditation as a 
potentially dangerous and albeit unnecessary discipline and rather recommends what he perceived to be a 
more practical, and less dangerous from a psychoanalytical standpoint, i.e. individuation supported by active 
imagination. 
This theoretical framework however, i.e. Jungian psychology, is entirely absent from Kālī's Child.  One could 
argue that perhaps this absence reflects more of a defect of the Western academic and scientific community 
and tradition at large rather than a glaring defect of the work itself, regardless it nonetheless represents an 
enormous rational and intellectual blind spot of of the work from an academic and scholarly perspective and 
in fact represents a significant missed opportunity to more accurately place Ramakrishna's life and teaching 
within a logical coherent and comprehensive Western psychological theoretical framework. 
But instead of abandoning said framework and looking for a more comprehensive theory of mind, or Soul, 
and reality itself within which categories of beings like Ramakrishna can be viewed on their own terms so to 
speak, beings which have exhibited many of the same characteristics as Ramakrishna and have put forth not 
only similar accounts of their so-called "experiences" but also who have put forth similar perspectives on the 
nature of reality itself which they have claimed to have directly experienced or realized in some supra-
physical and/or super-conscious way (such as have been well documented throughout history with Jesus, 
Buddha, Muḥammad, Moses, Zarathustra, Krishna, being perhaps the most predominant examples) and 
instead of recasting or reformulating the underlying psycho-intellectual framework and theoretical 
assumptions to support said exceptions, Kālī's Child however quite stubbornly to the underling mechanistic 
and process oriented behavior models which modern science has chosen to accept and adopt.
To a large degree, once the selection of Freudian psychology is determined as the definitive intellectual 
framework from within which Ramakrishna is to be interpreted, some level of repressed or deviant sexual 
behavior is undoubtedly a predetermined conclusion as these latent desires and their manifestation as 
"behaviors" is basically the foundation of Freudian psychology more or less.  Anyone who has spent any time 
in a psychotherapists office in the West can no doubt attest to a similar psychoanalytical experience along 
with a similar set of drawn conclusions.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy in some sense, although whether or not 
this analytical approach and the specific theoretical models that are leveraged in Kālī's Child to interpret 
Ramakrishna's life and teaching hold any validity, especially in light of the fact that Jungian psychology is not 
dealt with or addressed in any way, shape or form, can be left up to the reader to decide. 
If you don't believe in Jung's collective unconscious, and you don't believe that as Ramakrishna taught his 
disciples that "God can be seen with these very eyes", or Jesus for that matter that "the kingdom of God is 
within you", that is your prerogative.  But if you want to study the life of a man whose entire existence lay in 
this boundary beyond the conscious or the unconscious mind, then you need a paradigm to explain 
Ramakrishna's behavior where he could believe such things, teach such things, and make extraordinary, 
outrageous efforts to achieve such states of realization - enter the classically "Western" worldview which is 
so prominently reflected in both Freudian psychology which underpins Kālī's Child's arguments more or less, 
a model which clearly is wholly inadequate for trying to interpret or understand Ramakrishna from a theo-
philosophical vantage point which is the very vantage point that he "exists" in or from.  
In other words, if you do believe these higher states of consciousness exist, i.e. what we are calling 
supraconsciousness, and that we can tap into them directly via the human form, i.e. the jiva, which arguably 
not only represents the so-called "Eastern" perspective from a theo-philosophical and metaphysical 
standpoint, and which is also reflected quite clearly in the teaching of not only Ramakrishna but also by his 
monastic disciples such as Vivekananda and Saradananda then Freud's model of the psyche becomes wholly 
inadequate as an explanatory tool.  It doesn't even have a word to explain the whole paradigm within which 
these experiences happen or occur, if they can be said to happen or occur at all.  At least Jung provides a 
psycho-metaphysical framework and language within which these types of "states", or types of 
consciousness, can be describe - i.e. notion of the collective unconscious and the reality of archetypes that 
can be used along with the process of active imagination within the context of a process he refers to as 
individuation which effects an illumination of the individual psyche of sorts such that this collective 
unconscious can be harmoniously manifested within the life of an individual person, i.e. within the psyche of 
an individual as conceived of by Jung.

Upon reflection then, looking at the broader historical-cultural intellectual landscape in terms of how our 
worldview has evolved, at least in the West, since the advent of civilization in the 1st millennium BCE up until 
the modern era, the so-called Quantum Era within which we find ourselves, looking at the intellectual 
advancements, the revolutionary scientific and technological advancements that have led to post 
Enlightenment Era "progress", it is worth noting that a perhaps unintended consequence of this 
advancement, this progression as it were, is that we have not only found ourselves almost stuck with an 
objective realist understanding of existence, of reality, but also at the same time have become very much 
siloed in terms of expertise and focus within the breadth of the intellectual landscape itself, within academia 
essentially.  This is how academia has evolved since the Scientific Revolution in fact, how it has become 
structured in the modern era, again in the so-called Quantum Era where we find ourselves.  Specific 
intellectual domains within academia - Physics, Psychology, Biology, Comparative Religion, or any of the 
Humanities for that matter - have become, as a matter of necessity arguably, so intrinsically complex that a) 
competency and mastery of one specific domain is almost at the exclusion of mastery of any of the other 
intellectual domains or disciplines, and b) cross-disciplinary research is not necessarily frowned upon per se 
but is certainly not encouraged primarily because advancement in a specific field, discipline or domain of 
study is a function of research and advancement only within that specific field or discipline.
This laser like focus by discipline - a fundamental characteristic of academia in the modern era, a 
characteristic that is reinforced by the initiation process itself within the Academy, i.e. the creation of 
independent research along with an associated dissertation where a student must break new ground in their 
discipline of choice in order to be granted entrance into the Academy, i.e. granted their PhD  - while no 
doubt serves its purpose in terms of preparing those who are to enter the Academy (academia) to ensure 
they are qualified to enter it, and speak for it at some level within the specific discipline within which they 
have been trained, and at the same time contribute to the overall body of knowledge within said domain, the 
Academy itself, has had the unintended consequence of discouraging, if not outright disallowing, academics 
to pursue theories along what we might call grander and more broader cross-disciplinary lines as well as 
arguably discourage the analysis and criticism of the intellectual assumptions and foundations upon which 
the Academy itself, in its modern conception, rests.  In other words, there is no incentive for anyone pursuing 
a place within academia, pursuing their PhD, to question the very premise and authority, the very intellectual 
ground as it were, of the Academy itself.  This is the reason for example, that Robert Pirsig, the author of the 
1970s cult-classic Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance which did precisely that - i.e. call into question 
and attack the very intellectual foundations of the West as reflected by the teachings of the Academy - had 
to write, perform his research so to speak, outside of the confines of the Academy.  He was expelled from it 
basically, out of which his ideas formulated, and which freed him in some sense to pursue the work.
In fact, Pirsig's research, his insights if we may call them that, which initially began within the Academy as a 
University Professor in Bozeman Montana, effectively not only got him barred from the Academy, from 
teaching, but given the nature of his "epiphany", driven by his search for the definition of the notion of 
Quality from which he divined was the source of hypotheses which underpinned the development and 
evolution of Science, in fact eventually got him institutionalized.  It wasn't until he renounced his so-called 
epiphany, after undergoing high and frequent doses of electrodynamic currents, effectively "fried" in a 
literally sense, after which he was finally declared "fixed", after which be "safely" permitted back into society 
and could be rejoined with (what was left of) his family.   It wasn't until many years later that he wrote of 
this intellectual journey, retracing his steps as it were, which is essentially the basic narrative of Zen and the 
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance  The point being here of course is that one can argue that illumination in and 
of itself, the discovery - or realization even - of intellectual or supra-intellectual paradigms is not only not 
encouraged within academia, it is actually specifically discouraged.  While one can only theorize as to why 
this is the case, no doubt any intellectual framework upon which an entire socio-political structure is based 
and formulated - like the Academy in this case for example - is arguably not going to be very open to ideas 
which challenge the very foundations of its existence.  
Interestingly, and again not surprisingly, despite the far-reaching influence of Pirsig's philosophy, what he 
refers to as the Metaphysics of Quality, his teachings from either a philosophical perspective or intellectual 
perspective have yet to find themselves adopted in any sort mainstream way within academia, outside of a 
few classes in various Philosophy departments which focus on his work.   For very similar reasons arguably, 
at least one can surmise, academia barely incorporates Eastern theo-philosophical concepts outside of 
including Eastern philosophy as a general field of study within Comparative Religion departments necessarily.  
In fact, one can make the argument, that knowledge itself in the West, its boundaries and scope, which 
domains are to be included and which are excluded, is effectively defined by the curriculum of the Academy 
itself - the two almost self-supporting each other and reinforcing each other.  And herein lies one of the 
biggest challenges from an intellectual perspective when looking to tackle some of the world's biggest 
problems today, problems that as we mention to a large extent have an ideological basis - that is to say in 
order to provide a rational, intellectual framework that can cross the ideological chasm between the 
opposing worldviews between East and West as it were, it requires an almost wholesale revision, or at the 
very least a foundational reconstruction, of the very core of the Western intellectual foundation itself - as 
promoted, supported and reinforced by academia.  Our concept of knowledge in and of itself must shift in 
order for us to even be in a position to solve some of these global challenges and problems - again a problem 
cannot be solved by the same level of consciousness that created it.
One can draw a parallel with this type of intellectual revolution if we may call it that, one that is only 
beginning right now as the Quantum Era begins to take hold of the collective psyche of humanity, crossing 
Eastern and Western boundaries, as Yoga and Tai chi (Tàijí) and alternative forms of medicinal practices and 
treatment (and by alternative we mean primarily Eastern methods such as Ayurveda, acupuncture, etc.) 
continue to proliferate in the West, there is a concurrent shift in worldview, an assimilation of sorts, that is 
happening.  But it is worth noting that a) Yoga was first introduced in the West at the beginning of the 20th 
century so it's been a long time coming in this regard and b) the institutions and body politic, if we may call it 
that, have reasons to resist the proliferation and spread of these ideas.  Both from an economic perspective, 
as is the case with Health Care and Big Pharma companies who have a very large vested interest in the status 
quo and are in no way interested in supporting the proliferation of practices or techniques that, despite the 
fact that they may in fact have significant health benefits and/or be significantly cheaper than other forms of 
treatment, yet nonetheless represent a significant threat to their profit engines, or from a political or 
authoritarian perspective, as is the case with the Academy for example who also has an interest in preserving 
the status quo from an epistemological perspective.
The Enlightenment philosophers faced very similar challenges in a sense, except the authority that they were 
rebelling against was not intellectual or economical, but more political - as theological institutions in pre-
Enlightenment times represented strong political forces as well, and arguably held just as much influence and 
power, as the political machines of nation-states in and of themselves.  The Enlightenment philosophers, 
most notably of course Galileo and Copernicus, directly rebelled against the authority of the Church in the 
name of Science and Reason - risking not just exile and excommunication, from the Church as well as from 
the Universities that were very closely affiliated with theological institutions at the time, but in some cases - 
as was the case with Galileo for example, imprisonment.   Until eventually of course, as a result of the 
intellectual, social and political advancements and upheavals which ultimately characterize what we now 
refer to as the Scientific Revolution (circa end of 16th century to end of 17th), which was followed by the 
Enlightenment Era, or Age of Enlightenment (from circa the end of the 17th well into the 18th century) 
advancements in not just Science proper as we understand the discipline and field of study today but also 
socio-political revolutionary advancements that were driven by the Enlightenment Era philosophical 
achievements if we may call them that.  Manifestations of these socio-political developments included for 
example the French Revolution in (1789-1799), the English Revolution (1688), as well as the American 
Revolution (1775-1783).  
As a result, of course, not only did the socio-political landscape change forever, but the intellectual landscape 
did as well.  Post Enlightenment, the fields of Religion and Science, which had been seen as closely related for 
centuries, if not millennia, prior, were now effectively split.  Theology did not disappearing of course, but in 
terms of both political as well as intellectual influence, the sciences, and humanities, were now able to 
pursue their own goals independent of any influence from the Church.  While perhaps to a much less drastic 
or lesser extent, the likes of Bohm, Everett and even Pirsig in the 20th century, with respect to their proposed 
ontological frameworks, their systems of metaphysics really, also attempted, arguably somewhat less 
successfully than their Enlightenment Era predecessors,  to upend or invert the current prevailing (Western) 
ontological models which are so firmly entrenched in the Academy today.  Specifically, we refer to not just 
the prevailing ontological framework of the West, again the notion of what constitutes reality, an intellectual 
paradigm which is rooted firmly in Classical Mechanics, but also the prevailing epistemological framework of 
the West, the boundaries of knowledge that are officially approved and designated by the Academy itself .
These scientists, Physicists most of them (with the exception of Pirsig who calls himself a philosophologer, or 
one who analyzes or studies philosophy), attempt to reframe the boundaries of and our understanding of 
reality, based upon not just Classical Mechanics but also upon Quantum Mechanics.  And yet, despite their 
efforts, the models that these great minds put forth have nonetheless been effectively banished to the very 
deepest and least accessible corners of academia.  In fact, one cannot even find non-orthodox, i.e. non 
"Copenhagen", interpretations of Quantum Theory in standard text books on the subject - as if the 
implications of the Quantum Theory, and it's now well proven set of axioms and principles which are 
fundamentally "non-Classical", should have no bearing on our basic understanding of how the world works - 
be it at the quantum level or not (outside of certain philosophical circles, philosophy of science in particular, 
which is where one would have to look to find these respective theoretical models).
So to a certain extent, you can argue that these great thinkers of the 20th century, those that dared to 
attempt to integrate Quantum Theory's fundamentally non-local and non-deterministic conception of at least 
the quantum realm into a more broad and encompassing ontological framework that didn't necessarily reject 
the truth and validity of the so-called" Classical" view of universe - a reality that consisted solely of objects 
and observables moving through the continuum of spacetime, again what we call objective realism - but 
incorporated it into a more broad and encompassing intellectual, i.e. ontological, framework, have 
nonetheless been banished just the same.  They were not excommunicated from some central religious or 
intellectual authority necessarily, or imprisoned like Galileo some 300 years ago now , but nonetheless 
banished in the sense that their ideas have in no way been accepted by academia and as such effectively live 
in the dark corners of the intellectual universe left for authors like myself, who is also not part of the 
Academy proper, to discover and write about, effectively relegating such teachings, such doctrines and 
theories, to the intellectual backwaters where a) you have to do your own, fairly rigorous, research to find 
them, and b) most if not all PhD program will not accept any further research in such non "mainstream" 
subjects in order to get accredited as a "Doctor of Philosophy".
What we end up with, while most certainly better than where we were prior to the Scientific Revolution and 
the Enlightenment with respect to being able to freely pursue ideas and theories wherever they might take 
us, we have not nonetheless escaped entirely ontological or epistemological bias necessarily.  The bias has 
just morphed from being theological or "religious", into more intellectual or "Scientific, which again implies 
that anything "un-scientific" - like the realm of the Soul or its close intellectual and metaphysical corollaries 
like ethics or morality, or even the (potential) reality of higher states of consciousness - must be dealt with 
outside of academia, despite not just the relative importance of such topics, but the very ontological 
significance of such topics.  This is the very reason for example, that Aristotle taught metaphysics, before 
Physics (meta in the Greek means "before" or "prior to") and how metaphysics in fact came to be known, 
right up until after the Scientific Revolution in fact, for some two thousand years, as first philosophy.  This 
would be just fine except that from an ontological perspective, the world of Science, the physical sciences in 
particular (Physics primarily) has become, whether intentionally or not, equated with our Western notion of 
reality - our objective realism again.  That is to say, ontology - from a Western philosophical perspective 
which is where the term originated and therefore its specific domain of reference - is not just predisposed to 
an empirical and objective realist disposition, but it's very intellectual foundations rest on these so-called 
"Scientific" presumptions.  And therefore, as a byproduct of this way of thinking which is characteristically 
and uniquely "Western", one whose intellectual origins at least can be traced back to the Scientific 
Revolution, our conception of reality, is at best limited at worst, ultimately flawed.  This was the impetus of 
at least (some of) the work of David Bohm toward the end of his career, and the impetus of all of Robert 
Pirsig's work.
This limitation perhaps manifests itself most clearly and prominently in the current gap, chasm even, and all 
sorts of attempts to bridge said gap, between Science and Religion for example.  In the post Enlightenment 
Era intellectual paradigm in the West, that which is reflected most poignantly in academia, Religion has been 
relegated to the field of theology - literally the "study of" God, or gods as it were.  It is in the domain of 
theology for example, where ethics and morality have effectively been relegated for the most part, outside of 
philosophical circles at least.   As a result of these hard lines that have been drawn between theology and 
Science, the Religion and Science intellectual chasm as it were, that we are effectively confronted with in the 
Western epistemological landscape, is that these "higher" states of consciousness which hold such 
ontological significance in the various mystical traditions throughout the world - in particular in the Eastern 
theo-philosophical traditions, many of which have been around for literally millennia and arguably are 
rooted, intellectually and theo-philosophically at least, into the heart of human civilization itself - cannot be 
integrated in any meaningful way into really any aspect of the prevailing Western intellectual paradigm, 
outside of theology itself - and even this domain of study is arguably lacking in terms of its acceptance, and 
integration, of mysticism.  
These purported higher states of consciousness then, what in the East is viewed as a manifestation of the 
(most) true nature of reality itself, that which is most real you could say, ultimately defy not just definition 
(which the respective traditions within which these states are recognized would also concede for the most 
part), but also ultimately defy any sort of rational categorization whatsoever as established and promulgated 
by the full range of disciplines within academia, the presider over knowledge in the West.  This holds true in 
fact even in the domain of Psychology where these mystics, if they were to be (and some have) subjected to 
modern day psychoanalytic methods or techniques, have been and are typically diagnosed with all sorts of 
psychotic disorders, a challenge outlined in some detail in a recent article in Scientific American in fact.    As 
already mentioned, Robert Pirsig himself was diagnosed as having a psychotic breakdown after he 
experienced what can arguably be called an altered, or "higher" state of consciousness or awareness that, 
because he himself as well as the people who he was surrounded by had no frame of reference for such 
experiences or states, led to him being institutionalized and subject to electroshock treatment to "dispel" this 
awareness from his being so to speak so that he could re-integrate back into "normal" society.
It's this mystical experience really, at least how Pirsig describes it, that drove him to write - in an attempt to 
find the reason why our culture, i.e. the "West", seemed to be so devoid of not just enthusiasm, but of values 
in and of themselves.  This intellectual journey, where he literally and figuratively retraces his steps to that 
fateful day where Quality itself manifests directly and powerfully throughout his whole being to the point 
where he could not eat or function in any physical, or of course social, way, ends up leading to the 
formulation of what he calls a new metaphysics, i.e. his Metaphysics of Quality which is his intellectual 
solution to not only why we as a culture are devoid of values, but also in a sense also provides an intellectual 
bridge between Science and Religion by sidestepping theological questions entirely and yet affirming the 
existing of some sort of ground of existence from which what he calls "intuition", i.e. hypotheses again, 
originate from.  Of course this intellectual breakthrough that Pirsig had, given its complete divorce from, and 
abandonment of, any form of rational thought or any inclination toward social norms, stemming in no small 
measure from a direct communion with the source of Intellect itself, a total and compete comprehension of 
and absorption with of what he came to refer to as "Dynamic" Quality itself in its most pure and 
unadulterated form, led of course quite directly and efficiently to again him being institutionalized and 
thereby designated by society as a whole as "crazy".  Subsequently of course, even decades after his book 
and underlying philosophy has reached readers all across the world, his philosophy is still for the most part 
not accepted as a significant contribution to the intellectual landscape in the West, again academia.  
It's very difficult of course, given the author's background in Eastern philosophy and mystical practices in 
general, to not look at the experience that Pirsig had as a direct experience of a very high state of 
consciousness, akin to the what the Indian theo-philosophical tradition in particular (i.e. Yoga) refers to as 
samādhi, what the Buddhists refer to as nirvana, and what we refer to throughout as supraconsciousness.  Of 
course, as any seasoned practitioner of the mystical arts will tell you, and what Pirsig unfortunately had to 
find out (quite painfully) on his own, is that the experience of these higher states of consciousness, some of 
which can be induced by various means, methods and techniques should a) be done under the guidance of a 
competent teacher, and b) should be practiced in conjunction with various moral and ethical precepts and 
conjunctions, and c) hopefully if direct realization of the Absolute is in fact realized, you have the good 
fortune of not being immediately checked into a mental institution.  Despite the fact that this event, this 
experience of Pirsig's, had all the hallmark characteristics of true "mystical" experience, there existed no 
intellectual or social, or even psychological in fact, foundation for the rest of society, or even his family or 
friends for that matter, to interpret or understand this experience in any way - how he got there, what he 
was in fact experiencing, or perhaps better put what experience he had in fact lost himself in.  Furthermore, 
Pirsig himself, nor again those around him or close to him, had at their disposal any tools or techniques, any 
methods whatsoever, to facilitate "bringing him back" to a normal state of consciousness so to speak, to the 
normal physical plane of existence within which all typically live and exist in (all non-mystics at least).   As a 
result, as mentioned previously and perhaps not surprisingly, Pirsig was subsequently institutionalized and 
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and then during an extended stay in this facility that was designed 
for those who were unable to live in society, so-called "psychotics", in order to "fix" him and rid him of his 
"psychotic" tendencies, where he was treated with, among other things, extensive electroconvulsive therapy. 
 

If we look to the Eastern philosophical traditions however, there is no such relegation of experience, no 
matter what state or level of consciousness we speak of, to the back seat of "empirical reality", the very 
foundation of the objective realist worldview which underpins not just virtually the entire epistemological 
landscape of the West, but the ontological landscape as well -  Psychology included we may add.  In the 
Indian theo-philosophical tradition in particular however, this couldn't be further from the truth.  What we 
refer throughout as supraconsciousness for example, a term we use In order to try and provide some 
intellectual, primarily psychological (Freudian), frame of reference for the experience, is not so much an 
"experience" (a term that in and of itself presumes an objective realist ontology) but more a state of being, 
where a larger, or higher, state of consciousness "manifests" around or within an individual persona, or 
psyche, at a given point in the spacetime continuum, using standard 20th century Physicist jargon.
It is for this reason for example, that the term mysticism had to be manufactured in the West, coming into 
prominence in Comparative Religious circles in the last few decades or so, in order to provide at least some 
sort of intellectual foundation, as well as terminology, for something - really again some state of awareness 
or consciousness -  that defies any sort of rational or intellectual description, something that is arguably not 
irrational necessarily but, to coin a term, supra-rational.  Mysticism then, as a term in and of itself that sat 
outside the intellectual semantic landscape, provides a nice clean and neat, intellectual, box to place not just 
the Eastern theo-philosophical systems that recognized the verity and ontological significance of these higher 
states of awareness, or again consciousness, but also the aboriginal and shaman like practices that 
anthropologists and comparative religious scholars had encountered all throughout the world - each of them 
encountering these experiences within dozens if not hundreds of distinct sociological and theological 
environments, and yet at the same time recognizing that all of these experiences shared many commonalities 
and therefore were inherently mystical.  The discipline of mysticism then, the sub domain within 
Comparative Religion really, was established to discuss and explore these states of consciousness in a 
rationally coherent, and in classical Western modes in contrast and comparison to each other and to the 
classic Western worldview, i.e. again objective realism in order to (attempt to) provide some sort of frame of 
reference for what the Eastern theo-philosophical traditions at least consider to be the very ground of reality 
itself for thousands of years.  
Again, in virtually all of these so-called "mystical" traditions, the experience which we have come to know or 
understand as intrinsically mystical - in the Western sense that this term is understood as something distinct 
from "every day" experience and which, by definition really, defies any sort of rational explanation definition, 
or description - is described in the various traditions as a sort of communion with a higher state of being or 
some sort of expanded form of consciousness.  As such, given that it clearly expresses an idea, or again an 
experience, which exists beyond any type of objective realist conception of reality, it therefore is beyond any 
sort of intellectual framework that can be conceived by the mind, the mind in this sense representing an 
entirely intellectual construct which is considered to be, primarily again according to the Eastern theo-
philosophical (mystical) traditions more or less, subservient to, or perhaps better put a lower order 
manifestation of, the mystical experience itself. 
This does not mean however that the mystical experience, the state of expanded consciousness or 
awareness, or again what we call supraconsciousness, which represent such an integral and fundamental 
component of the metaphysical and ontological landscape of Eastern theo-philosophy in general and in 
particular the Indian theo-philosophical tradition, is not described or articulated in any way, shape or form.  
It, in fact, in these various traditions is associated with certain epithets and assigned various terms or 
expressions that reflect the true import and weight of the experience, and in turn reflect the ontological, and 
theological, significance of, the state of consciousness or being which, at least again according to the Eastern 
theo-philosophical traditions in particular, is accessible to, or perhaps better put the true essence of, each 
and every one of us.  This is what the Indian theo-philosophical notion of Satcitānanda represents, as well as 
what Brahman from an anthropomorphic theo-philosophical perspective at least, also represents.  We also 
find for example, a very extensive and detailed terminology set forth in the Yoga Sūtras, where not only are 
the specific practices to elicit such higher states of consciousness outlined in detail, but also the higher state 
of consciousness itself, i.e. samādhi, is also referred to and explained in some detail as well, even if by 
analogy and metaphor only.  
A consequence of our distinctly Western, reductionist and somewhat restrictive worldview, with its 
respective underlying epistemological assumptions upon which it is constructed, is that since it effectively 
relies and depends upon Science as a discipline for discerning not just truth from fiction, but also the 
boundaries of what can actually be defined as well (empiricism), we end with a fairly restricted conception of 
knowledge and reality, one that holds the physical realm, the realm of the senses, as more ontologically 
significant than the psychological, or inner, world.  This is juxtaposed of course, with the Eastern, again 
primarily Indian, epistemological frameworks which not only do not restrict the notion of reality only to the 
physical world or realm, but also include an epistemological landscape which distinguishes directly between 
forms of knowledge across the sensory spectrum, psychological and supra-sensory included.  
Where this leaves us from a Western epistemological standpoint at least, is that since these so-called 
"higher" states of consciousness are, by nature "subjective" and lack empirical verifiability, and as such most 
certainly cannot be considered as reflective of, or even hinting of, any sort of inclusion in our definition of 
reality, from an empirical perspective of course, they are excluded from the epistemological landscape itself.  
And a byproduct of this epistemological exclusion, these topics are effectively left out of academia proper, 
with the exception perhaps of again some very unique and rare Comparative Religion, or perhaps 
Anthropology courses which may touch on mysticism, or its corollary shamanism, as a purely intellectual 
endeavor.  And yet this notion of the (potential) existence of higher states of consciousness or awareness, 
again supraconsciousness, is in fact true and real from an epistemological perspective, i.e. fundamentally real, 
which of course is one of the core principles and beliefs of virtually all of the Indian theo-philosophical 
schools and traditions, would effectively stand our current (Western) conception of reality, one entirely 
devoid of not just theology but even spirituality, entirely on its head - quite literally almost. 
Nowhere else is this quite restrictive, empiricist and causally deterministic, classically Western, ontological 
worldview, manifest its ontological limitations as in the Standard, aka "Copenhagen", Interpretation of 
Quantum Mechanics , where some of the very fundamental premises regarding the nature of the reality 
underlying the model, the quantum observables as they are sometimes called - specifically the principles of 
entanglement and locality - sit in stark opposition to the prevailing understanding of how the world basically 
works, i.e. our Western conception of reality which is based upon fundamental principles (assumptions) such 
as causal determinism, locality and objective realism, i.e. the foundations of Classical Mechanics.  And yet 
despite this, outside of some fancy mathematical gymnastics that have been employed to try and explain 
Quantum Mechanics in a fully deterministic framework, i.e. the now quite popular many-worlds 
interpretation of Quantum Theory, the idea that the true nature of reality, of existence itself, might not be 
truly causally deterministic, or even objective in any real sense of the term, is literally beyond 
comprehension.  It breaks the model, quite literally. 
And yet these Eastern theo-philosophical traditions, in particular again the Indian theo-philosophical 
tradition, have been grounded since inception upon the premise of the ontological superiority of 
consciousness, or awareness, over objective reality.  This has been the case since the very dawn of their 
respective civilizations within which the theo-philosophical systems themselves emerged, perhaps the very 
reason why these belief systems persist, a worldview where different levels or domains of knowledge, as a 
theo-philosophical concept, can co-exist and at the same time not contradict each other.  What we find in the 
Indian theo-philosophical tradition in particular, arguably one of its defining features in fact, is that the 
conception of knowledge, the underlying epistemological framework, not only fully integrates what we in the 
West have now split into the separate and distinct domains which we call "Religion" and "Science", but also 
integrates the notion of, the fundamental truth of, higher states of consciousness, that exist in a very real 
sense above or beyond "physical" reality as a higher order dimension of sorts from which physical reality 
emerges or manifests.  
By so doing, the theo-philosophical system effectively subsumes subject-object metaphysics into their 
conception of reality, i.e. their ontology, as well as into their epistemological framework, i.e. their concept of 
knowledge in toto, while at the same time not sacrificing the notion of physical reality, and the associative 
underlying predictive and technological power of empiricism or objective realism in and of themselves as 
integral parts, components, of the entire ontological framework as it were.  This is accomplished quite 
elegantly, by distinguishing between higher and lower forms of knowledge.  The former being classified and 
understood as existing above or beyond our basic cognitive or intellectual capabilities, and the latter being 
defined as being bound directly by such intellectual capabilities, the realm of the senses as it were - what in 
the West is the domain of Science.  This epistemological framework in fact, is one of the marked 
characteristics of the Indian philosophical tradition, which not only allows for a much more broad conception 
of knowledge generally speaking, one which incorporates and integrates the mystical experience into it 
(defined again by such terms as Satcitānanda or Brahman, constructs which tie more or less directly into the 
underlying mythological tradition from which they emerge) but also lower forms of knowledge as well which 
govern not only the world of natural phenomenon but also sociological phenomena such as ethics, morality 
and of course the world of name and form within which we as individuals are ultimately bound to and by.  
The Indian theo-philosophical tradition provides these various metaphysical frameworks, epistemological 
frameworks really, within which all forms of knowledge, both higher and lower forms, can be understood in 
relation to each other and can be understood within the context of the entire domain of human knowledge 
of experience which again includes the mystical domain, the physical domain, as well as the sociological and 
psychological domains.   In a sense this epistemological framework is much more closely aligned with 
Aristotle, in its breadth and scope as well ontology, rather than the epistemological framework of the West in 
the modern era which again rests upon the very often overlooked, and definitely underestimated, 
metaphysical assumptions of objective realism and empiricism.  Nonetheless, in this classically "Eastern" 
worldview, one which is by nature not reductionist or empirical, we find this expanded intellectual, 
epistemological, paradigm that incorporates what we are calling higher, i.e. mystical, forms of knowledge, 
which correlate directly to what we are calling supraconsciousness which in turn is the most ontologically 
significant principle in these so-called "mystical" traditions.  These higher states of awareness, or again higher 
states of consciousness, are considered to be verifiable truths within these (mystical) theo-philosophical 
traditions in the sense that a) the experiences themselves can be confirmed by other advanced practitioners 
of these mystical arts, i.e. mystics or spiritual "adepts", b) the experiences conform to the underlying theo-
philosophical texts which describe these mystical states in some detail, and c) that the lasting effects of the 
mystical experience are also verified against the theo-philosophical literature and tradition as well, effects 
such as moral fortitude, compassion, sympathy for others, and other classically "religious" attributes or 
qualities. 
Regardless, in these very ancient belief systems, one's that existed not only prior to monotheistic theology, 
but also clearly pre-date civilization itself (in the West or East) we find that the necessary qualification of the 
worldview as "mystical" is not only not necessary, but redundant in a way because the theo-philosophical 
system reflects the underlying worldview of the people and culture within which it emerged which is 
intrinsically mystical you could say.  And in this "Eastern" worldview, which retains and is reflective of an 
ontological paradigm that is arguably almost a complete inversion of the predominant intellectual paradigm 
in the West, these lower forms of knowledge are not abandoned for these higher forms (as is the case in the 
standard Western intellectual paradigms where the truth of these supraconscious states is rejected on purely 
Scientific grounds, i.e. the states in and of themselves are purely "subjective" and as such are "unverifiable") 
but are viewed as complimentary and supportive of, the basic underlying ground of reality itself -  a reality 
that is closer to what we in the West like to refer to as consciousness or (pure) awareness than it is 
"objective" in any way.  Using David Bohm's construct of implicate and explicate orders from which his grand 
ontology is constructed, terms, these mystical states simply reflect a higher order reality from which the 
physical and mental world emerge from as no less true, and yet lower, forms of order or structure - explicate 
order domains that manifest from a higher, implicit, order which is fundamentally mystical in nature.

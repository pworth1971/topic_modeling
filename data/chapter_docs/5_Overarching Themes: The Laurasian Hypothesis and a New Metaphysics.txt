While we have attempted to describe the nature of the work, and its underlying "purpose", in Aristotelian 
terms , whenever the author stops to think about it, or whenever he is asked "why" he's doing it, there 
never appears to be a clear and concise answer to the question, and least not to the author even though a 
logical and rational response can be given.  In fact, it is arguably a reflection of such a basic materialistic and 
self-obsessed capitalistic society that we live in (that the author lives in at least that is the very source of a) 
the question itself, no one would consider creating art for art's sake, and b) a reflection of this basic 
philosophical quandary that the author is attempting to uncover and potentially solve that the answer that 
he provides is never really satisfactory to anyone who asks.  
In brief then, it's never really not quite clear to the author why we should complete such an extensive and 
broad reaching work such as this.  The author certainly never set out to do such a thing at the start, and 
arguably had he known how significant an effort it was we never would have embarked on it to begin with 
(but the same could probably be said for many works of creation so in that sense this is no different).  
Nonetheless, here we are.  So "go figure" is perhaps as good an explanation as any that can be found to 
explain the "situation", if we may call it that.  But the how we got here is a point worth noting as well.  The 
means of production as it were, especially given that the author did not embark on a this extensive a work to 
begin with.  In fact, quite the contrary, after Snow Cone Diaries we thought we were "finished".  But what we 
found was that once we started writing and producing material on a broad range of topics, mostly regarding 
theo-philosophical development in antiquity, each topic led to another related one, which in turn led to 
another, and another and so on and so on until a very broad and far reaching chain was developed and 
certain patterns emerged that the author could not find in any of the existing literature.  
And so it was simply by the constant authoring and writing (and publishing draft material periodically on the 
web)  of small chunks of thought as it were, essays really, that after a long period of time of relatively 
consistent effort on topics that were all of interest, and all connected in one way or another, and all authored 
from a perspective that the author thought was unique, it became clear not only that such a work was 
possible, but almost that it was essential and that "it had to be done".  It's hard to explain really, but perhaps 
it is not much of a stretch to imagine that many authors have similar experiences with their creative process, 
and indeed such was the reliance and import of the Muses of ancient Greece who were believed to inspire 
the mythic poets of old in fact.   From a pure academic perspective, which is shorthand for Western 
intellectual and Scientific perspective, there are at least two prevailing sentiments or theories that are put 
forth in Parts I and II of this work that the author believes should force us to recast or reformulate modern 
views and perceptions, our fundamental understanding of really, the relationship between and among the 
prevailing mythos (primarily cosmogonic, i.e. creation narratives and mythologies) and philosophical 
traditions of the respective civilizations that are covered in this work - namely the civilizations of the "West" 
as exemplified by the ancient Sumer-Babylonian, Egyptian, Persian and Greco-Roman cultural traditions, and 
the civilizations of the "East" as exemplified by the Indo-Aryans - as reflected specifically in the literature 
attributed to this ancient people namely the Vedas and the Upanishads, and the philosophy put forth by 
Buddha - and the philosophy of the ancient Chinese peoples as reflected in the Yìjīng, the Dàodé Jīng and the 
other ancient Chinese "Classics". 
First, as we scale our view out from a regional and historical perspective, looking at the overall development 
of human intellectual developments from a more global, or perhaps more specifically a more integrated 
"Eastern" and "Western" view, we find and explore the meaning and definition of what we term "Indo-
European philosophy", a term we define as the set of beliefs, the underlying theological and philosophical 
views, which underpin not only the Hellenic philosophical tradition which basic provides the foundations of 
the Western intellect (which we know borrowed at ;east to some extent from its "direct" neighbors to the 
East, i.e. the so-called "Near Eastern" traditions which much of the academic material refers to as "Oriental" 
but really consist of the Sumer-Babylonians and Persians/Iranians mostly), but also the philosophy of the 
Indo-Aryans as well, which is reflected most directly in the Upanishads but which also forms the basis of 
Buddhist philosophy as well.  All of these theo-philosophical traditions emerge in the historical record 
throughout Eurasia, from the Mediterranean to the Indian subcontinent to the Far East, in the middle of the 
first millennium BCE or so, give or take a century or two, therefore representing the age of man that we refer 
to as the "Axial Age". 
Second, as we analyze and study the various theo-philosophical traditions that emerge across Eurasia and the 
Mediterranean in the first millennium BCE, the author concludes that the similarities and common threads of 
thought that we find in these various theo-philosophical traditions represent not the specific borrowing and 
exchange of ideas, but the remnants of ancient belief systems that that reach much further back in antiquity 
than considered by most scholars and academics of ancient history.   One thread of commonality already 
mentioned is traced back to a distinctly Indo-European theo-philosophical system that runs parallel 
(backward in time) to the spread of Indo-European languages, a subject of theoretical philological (study of 
languages) inquiry in the last century or so which provides the basis for the term "Indo-European", a 
language family which is known to include Sanskrit, Greek and Latin among other languages that were 
prevalent in the Mediterranean and Near East in the 4th, 3rd and 2nd millennium BCE.  
We extend this philological theoretical construct, i.e. "Indo-European", to the domain of "theo-philosophy", 
arguing that the commonalities that we find throughout the Indo-European landscape from a theological and 
philosophical perspective are the result of the shared theo-philosophical ancestry of these peoples that 
populated this region in antiquity rather than the result of cultural borrowing and/or some type of collective 
unconscious (in the Jungian sense), positing the existence of parent theo-philosophical belief system of sorts 
that runs parallel with Proto-Indo-European language that was inherited, or at the very least strongly 
influenced, the (spoken) languages of the Greeks, the Indo-Aryans (Sanskrit speaking), the Sumer-
Babylonians and the Persians (the Indo-Iranian family of languages).  We extend this theory to include not 
only these people that shared linguistic characteristics with each other, but also to include the (ancient) 
Egyptians as well, an ancient civilization that although clearly has a different history and origin that the 
ancient Hellenic people, i.e. the ancient Greeks, it nonetheless evolves from a cultural and theo-philosophical 
standpoint very much aligned with the ancient Greeks after the 2nd millennium BCE or so when the two 
cultures begin to have very constant and persistent contact with each other.  
The thesis is that this Proto-Indo-European theo-philosophy provides the basic theological and mythological 
structure, and the underlying and associative meanings which then morph into philosophy proper as writing 
becomes more prevalent in the first millennium BCE, providing the foundations from a theo-philosophical 
perspective for the majority of Eurasia in antiquity - outside of the Far East/China basically which in the 
author's view reflects an even older theo-philosophical tradition, older than Proto-Indo-European that is.  
Along with this Proto-Indo-European theo-philosophical belief system, we propose an even deeper lineage 
across all of Eurasia that naturally presents itself as one looks across these classically "Eastern" and 
"Western" divides and invariably finds many common intellectual threads and similarities between the 
different metaphysical and philosophical systems.  This theory effectively follows the lines of the Laurasian 
mythos hypothesis of Harvard Sanskrit scholar and professor Michael Witzel that he outlines in his seminal 
work, Origin of the World's Mythologies, but we extend the hypothesis from a simple shared narrative as it 
were that explains the shared cosmologies of these ancient peoples throughout Eurasia, to a shared 
intellectual worldview of sorts, one which provides the foundations for theo-philosophical systems that 
emerge in the first millennium BCE that we find reflected in the earliest works of these respective "Eastern" 
and "Western" early civilizations when writing first develops and these belief systems are first codified and 
philosophy in antiquity starts to take shape across Eurasia.  
These developments establish what we have to come to refer to throughout this work as "Eurasian 
philosophy", an altogether unique perspective on philosophy in antiquity that brings together both Western 
philosophy and Eastern philosophy (in antiquity) under a single umbrella so as to emphasize the fundamental 
relationship of these seemingly disparate and distinctive worldviews, worldviews that nonetheless share 
many common motifs and themes which point to common (intellectual) lineage from the Neolithic Era which 
our modern understanding of genetics and human migration sheds significant light on.  From this more broad 
and deeper perspective surrounding these ancient bodies of knowledge that we find in the first extant set of 
literature that appears in Eurasia in antiquity, we can recognize Western and Eastern philosophy as 
representing two different streams of thought yes, but also at the same time as individual manifestations and 
interpretations of a single, shared, base of wisdom that reaches deep into antiquity.  It then shows up in this 
so-called "Axial Age" throughout Eurasia in various forms that are socio-politically, linguistically and 
geographically distinct, but nonetheless representative of a body of knowledge that comes at least to some 
degree from a shared heritage, providing insights into the mind of pre-historical man that have never really 
been explored before, allowing for (calling for really) a new approach and framework for understanding 
ancient philosophy from which our modern designation of "Eastern" and "Western" comes from.
This Laurasian hypothesis, which is in effect a deep, pre-historical shared ancestry hypothesis for the ancient 
peoples of Eurasia, not only aligns quite well with the archeological record, as evidenced for example in the 
Cave art findings  as well as the Venus figurines motif  that we find spread across Eurasia in the of the 
Upper Paleolithic (circa 50,000 to 10,000 years ago), but also aligns with what we know is the common 
lineage from a genetic standpoint that all these ancient peoples share, having discovered in the last decade 
or so that all European as well as Asian peoples (and Americans as well) all stem from a relatively small 
population of homo sapiens that migrated out of Africa roughly around 100,000 years ago and which in turn 
gave rise to an Eastern expansion some 60,000 to 70,000 years ago give or take.   
While this reaches very far back into ancient history, much further back than we have a record of from an 
historical perspective of course, and into a time period of history where even the archeological record is quite 
sparse, from the author's perspective these common theo-philosophical threads that we find across Eurasia 
as exemplified in the very similar systems of metaphysics and theology, and underlying themes of 
numerology, skepticism and idealism that we find predominant in both the Yìjīng and the Dàodé Jīng from the 
Far East as well as in the theo-philosophy of both the Pre-Socratics (e.g. Heraclitus, Parmenides which then 
dovetail and influence the theo-philosophy of Plato) as well as the Indo-Aryans and the Indo-Iranians is best 
explained by a shared common ancestral hypothesis, i.e. the Laurasian hypothesis, coinciding of course with a 
much more lasting and persistent theo-philosophical system which is typically attributed to these "pre-
historic" peoples, rather than any of the alternative theoretical hypotheses that have currently been 
proposed, with perhaps the "cultural borrowing" and "cross pollination" hypotheses being the most 
widespread despite the lack of evidence surrounding it.
We see traces and threads of this shared common ancestral theo-philosophical belief system from the late 
Upper Paleolithic throughout Eurasian antiquity as reflected in the underlying worship of the great god of the 
heavens as the greatest of all deities and presider over the natural world, the emergence of the "ordered" 
cosmos from a "watery, dark abyss", the myth of the primordial "cosmic egg" from which the earth and 
heavens are born, sacrificial worship in general to anthropomorphic deities that are representative of various 
aspects of nature, the worship and veneration of ancestors, i.e. hero worship, etc.  We find more or less most 
of these theo-philosophical features persistent throughout virtually all of these Eurasian cultures in the first 
millennium BCE as these distinctive civilizations begin to emerge and flourish, as respective areas of imperial 
influence start to spread and expand and spheres of socio-political influence along with it, and in turn as the 
respective theo-philosophical belief systems become codified and systematized as writing is invented in order 
to support these vast empires with a more cohesive and synthesized "culture" to a large extent. 
While forms of worship and the perspective on the "divine" are very different in ancient China than in the 
area of Indo-European influence no doubt, the systems of metaphysics and the core flavor as it were of the 
underlying theo-philosophical systems that emerge in these geographically distinct regions for which we have 
no evidence of cultural contact points to either a) some sort of shared common theo-philosophical source 
from which these belief systems stemmed from that aligns with human migration patterns and settlement 
(Witzel's Laurasian hypothesis  mapped to philosophy rather than mythology), or b) the existence of an 
eternal and ever present theo-philosophy of sorts which aligns with Jungian collective unconscious, or c) 
some combination of the two.  These facts, these similarities and common ground from a theo-philosophical 
perspective across such a wide expanse of geography in regions that we do not have any evidence for direct 
cultural or economic contact at the very least forces us to consider whether or not the similarities and 
commonalities are shared precisely because they all stem from a common source or origin which reaches 
much further back into antiquity than is previously thought and again reflects a theo-philosophical tradition, 
and a corresponding intellectual capability and transmission mechanism, of ancient man that reaches much 
further back into pre-history than is commonly held in academic and ancient historical circles today.  
While the Laurasian hypothesis then might seem perhaps somewhat far-fetched upon first glance, upon 
deeper reflection and analysis, at least from the author's perspective having studied such topics over a long 
period of time, the hypothesis starts to look a lot more possible, and in fact perhaps even probable, once the 
ancient theo-philosophical systems are looked at through a broader and more expansive lens and when the 
context of human migration patterns, and the overlapping archeological evidence as thin as it is, is all taken 
together as a whole.

Another one of the fundamental topics and themes underlying this work, in particular covered in Part IV of 
this work, material devoted to ontological considerations , is that how we define reality, what we consider 
the basis and boundaries of knowledge itself, must encompass psychological and perceptive "conceptions" in 
order to be considered "complete".  This is, from the author's perspective, not only an absolute requirement 
from a rational and logical perspective but also from a Scientific perspective as well as reflected in some of 
the implications of Quantum Theory, one of the most revolutionary Scientific "discoveries" of the modern 
era.
In this author's view, this necessary epistemological expansion as it were, is based not only upon the state of 
Scientific knowledge in the 21st century as reflected in the current state of Physics as reflected by the 
prevailing truths of Classical Mechanics as well as Quantum Mechanics, but also based upon what we 
consider to be the basic, self-evident, truths surrounding the reality of states of consciousness that are 
evoked and produced by the art of meditation, what we refer to as the supraconscious throughout this work.  
We will show that these states of Being as it were, borrowing the terminology used by the earliest Hellenic 
philosophers such as Parmenides, Plato and Aristotle, represent the very source of Western philosophical and 
intellectual tradition itself and yet have been effectively lost from an epistemological perspective as the state 
of reason, and theology in general, have evolved over the last 2500 years.  
These pure states of unadulterated consciousness, i.e. again supraconsciousness, that are effectively 
experienced by advanced mystical practitioners, represent the very foundation of mysticism in all its forms 
and are in the author's view indicative of a reality that exists beyond the realm of subjects and objects  and 
as such should, and must, be incorporated into any comprehensive and complete description of knowledge 
(i.e. epistemology) that is to serve mankind going forward such that our relationship not only to ourselves 
(viewed as "spiritual" entities rather than physical biochemical and neurological processes) is better 
understood and comprehended in order to support a more "fulfilling" and "nourishing" life experience, 
arguably the goal of each and every one of us, but also that our relationship to each other and the natural 
world, i.e. our "environment", is better understood to effect a more harmonious and balanced existence for 
human society as a whole.
These states of Being, our supraconsciousness, are looked at in detail not only within the context of the 
Indian philosophical tradition as a whole, but also within the context of the well documented and studied 
spiritual practices and experiences of the 19th century sage Ramakrishna , the teacher and spiritual 
inspiration for one of the most influential and prominent figures of the modern Yoga tradition in the West, 
i.e. Swami Vivekananda.  The reality of the supraconscious is a constant theme throughout this work and is 
explored in detail in Part IV and V of this work and from the author's perspective has significant implications 
on not just our definition of knowledge itself, but also on the place of theology, morality and ethics, as well as 
metaphysics (again what is referred to as first philosophy following the tradition of Aristotle) within the 
context of any inquiry and study of the nature of reality.  
We argue that the initial conception of knowledge by the earliest Western philosophers, i.e. the Pre-
Socratics, Plato and Aristotle specifically, incorporated (or at the very least did not altogether dismiss) the 
experiential reality that was reflected in these so-called "mystical" experiences, even if they did not explicitly 
discuss or analyze them directly.  This is reflected for example in Plato's conception of knowledge, i.e. his 
epistemology, as divided into the world of Being , which was eternal and changeless, and the world of 
Becoming  which is characterized by constant change or movement - a metaphysical and theo-philosophical 
conception which in fact forms the basis of Aristotle's epistemology, i.e. his notion of being qua being.   
We further argue that this notion of change as the basic underlying principle of the natural world is not only a 
characteristic of early Hellenic philosophy, but is also a prominent theo-philosophical construct of ancient 
Chinese philosophy, i.e. the philosophy of the Far East in antiquity, providing the basis as it were for the 
argument of a shared theo-philosophical heritage that reaches much further back in antiquity than is typically 
considered and which connects all of the ancient peoples throughout Eurasia to at least some degree.  As 
such, one of the overarching themes of this work is that in looking at the roots of rational inquiry in the West, 
through the looking glass as it were, we not only find a much broader and comprehensive definition of 
knowledge and reality which from the author's perspective is a more accurate and complete depiction of the 
full state of human experience as well as the natural world and surroundings which he finds himself in, but 
that it - as Quantum Theory forces us to do to a large extent - includes the exploration of the nature of the 
Soul and the full spectrum of cognitive experience, along with theological inquiry in general - all attributes 
that are completely absent from modern Science.  
The author argues that this epistemological and metaphysical expansion or revision as it were, represents a 
requisite intellectual step that we must take as a species in order for us to progress and evolve in the 21st 
century and beyond in order to comprehend not just our fundamental interrelationship and interdependence 
upon each other for the achievement of individual, social and global harmony and order, but also a requisite 
step to truly comprehend and incorporate the fundamental interdependence and interrelationship we have 
with our natural environment and the planet as a whole, and in turn the universal cosmic order.  For like it or 
not we have reached a point in our human history and evolution, and the state of the planet and the 
environment in fact, where our relationship to the environment is no longer just a philosophical or 
theoretical problem to be studied or debated, but that the dire state of the planet itself, our home upon 
which we (as well as all the species on the planet in fact) depend upon for survival, is a natural byproduct and 
outgrowth, a direct causally related phenomenon, of the very fundamental and basic misconceptions and 
misunderstanding of the nature of reality itself, the full exploration of which again is a core theme that 
underpins the bulk of this work.

As an illustration of the implications of such a reformulation of how we define reality and knowledge, 
rejecting what we call objective realism as inadequate and incomplete at best, let us look at how reality, and 
knowledge thereof, is conceived of by Aristotle, a discipline known in philosophical circles as epistemology 
and a constant theme throughout this work.  While we cover Aristotle's philosophy and metaphysics at 
length in specific chapters within this work, let's summarize the principles here and in so doing look at how 
that compares to the objective realist, i.e. subject-object metaphysics conception of reality which provides 
the foundation of the Western intellectual and academic tradition, i.e. Science.   From a subject-object 
metaphysics perspective, a conceptual and metaphysical framework which rests upon the notions of causal 
determinism and objective realism, reality - and in turn (empirical) knowledge itself in fact - is fundamentally 
defined and characterized by various quantitative and qualitative measurement phenomena.  Effectively if 
we cannot "measure" a thing, if its objective reality cannot be confirmed or verified, it doesn't exist.   
Science as it were sits at the very pillar of Western intellectual thought, with all other disciplines subservient 
to it, which is not quite the way the early Hellenic philosophers, our intellectual ancestors, conceived of the 
world to say the least. 
From an objective realist point of view then, this work - this very Book which you hold in your hands right 
now and are reading (unless you are reading it electronically in which case we refer here to the tablet of 
device upon which you are electronically seeing these words and reading them upon) - is defined by various 
quantitative and qualitative measurements, each of which when combined together give us an empirically 
verifiable definition of what this work, this Book in its published form, actually "is".  What makes it "real".  
How we describe it and upon which its reality in the physical world ultimately depends upon.  In this sense 
we can say definitively, in a manner that is "verifiable by scientific methods of inquiry" that it consists of a 
certain number of words, a certain number of pages, a certain number of Chapters and Parts, that it was 
written by the author, that it was written using software called Microsoft Word, that it is written in the 
English language, that it was "published" in 2017, and even that it "references" and "quotes" various other 
texts in a variety of disciplines that were "published" by other authors at other dates and times in history.  
In its final form, this work "exists" as a physical Book with a certain number of pages that is published by a 
certain publisher, that it weighs a certain number of pounds, that the pages are made up some form of paper 
that comes from some sort of tree perhaps, and that even a certain number of "copies" of the book are sold 
and delivered via various forms of mail and shipping centers.  All of these are accurate "facts" and again, 
verifiable "truths" that describe this work and can help another person understand what it "is" from an 
objective realist perspective of course.  However, it should be readily apparent to the reader that these facts, 
while true and descriptive at a very basic and "physical" level, leave out very significant "characteristics" of 
this work that make it unique and help us more fully understand, or comprehend, what this Book truly "is".  
In more simple terms, it should be reality apparent that the aforementioned definition, while accurate and 
"descriptive", is inadequate and lacking to a large extent.  
As an alternative definition and description of this work, we look to Aristotle's more broad conception of 
reality, how he defines the qualities of a "thing" which provide the basis for our understanding it as it were, a 
notion which is typically transliterated in modern philosophical circles as the somewhat misleading (and most 
certainly obtuse) expression being qua being.   To Aristotle, to understand the nature of a "thing", the 
qualities which make it "real", we must understand all of the ways, all of the "reasons", which brought such a 
"thing" into existence.  This is the topic that he covers in painstaking detail in his seminal work Metaphysics, 
or that which literally comes before Physics, as Aristotle initially conceived of the intellectual discipline, and 
what we refer to throughout this work, following modern Western philosophical parlance, as first philosophy.  
From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy we find a good explanation of Aristotle's epistemological 
framework, an intellectual framework which underpins his entire system of philosophy in fact - that 
knowledge of a thing, what Aristotle himself referred to in the Greek as epistêmê , must be underpinned by 
a complete and comprehensive causal based depiction of said object of understanding.  

In Physics II 3 and Metaphysics V 2, Aristotle offers his general account of the four causes.  This account is 
general in the sense that it applies to everything that requires an explanation, including artistic production and 
human action.  Here Aristotle recognizes four types of things that can be given in answer to a why-question:

-	The material cause: "that out of which", e.g., the bronze of a statue.
-	The formal cause: "the form", "the account of what-it-is-to-be", e.g., the shape of a statue.
-	The efficient cause: "the primary source of the change or rest", e.g., the artisan, the art of bronze-
casting the statue, the man who gives advice, the father of the child.
-	The final cause: "the end, that for the sake of which a thing is done", e.g., health is the end of 
walking, losing weight, purging, drugs, and surgical tools. 

Knowledge then from Aristotle's perspective, Aristotle's epistemological framework as it were, as defined as 
the sum total of these four distinct types of causality, types which while are somewhat mutually exclusive are 
yet at the same time (from his perspective at least) exhaustive, not only consists of in the aggregate a much 
more broad conception of the notion of causality itself than we are used to in modern intellectual and 
academic circles in the West, but also allows for, and fundamentally supports, a much broader definition of 
reality itself as compared with the modern Western intellectual conception of reality which again is 
underpinned by the twin pillars of causal determinism and objective realism.  
Aristotle's conception of reality then, is based upon the very same notion of causality which underpins the 
prevailing intellectual paradigm of the West, i.e. the Western worldview, i.e. subject-object metaphysics, 
which as it turns out has significant ontological (i.e. the study of the nature of being or reality) implications - 
a subject which is covered at length in Part IV and Part V of this work.  However, Aristotle's notion of 
causality, the foundation of his epistemological framework, integrates the notion of form (in the Platonic 
sense), as well as purpose (teleology), into its very definition and therefore provides the basis for a much 
broader intellectual paradigm of understanding than what we are accustomed to in the West, one which 
comes closer (although not quite entirely) to the Eastern philosophical conception of reality in fact, one 
which includes the broader conception of what we have come to call consciousness itself.
Using Aristotle's epistemological framework then, we can describe the material cause of this work, this Book, 
as the computer and software which was used to write the words and design the chapters and format the 
paragraphs, pages, footnotes, etc.  The formal cause is the overall structure of the work, its intended form 
from an organizational perspective - the structure of the Parts and their respective Chapters - as well as the 
overall content of the work, i.e. its subject matter.  The efficient cause is the author himself, the writer of the 
work, and the final cause, the purpose for which the work is completed, is for the advancement of human 
knowledge in general, not only as it relates to ancient history, but also as it relates to modern conceptions of 
reality of course.  
Once we understand each of these causal aspects of how and why this work, this Book came into being as it 
were, what makes it real, each of them individually as well as all of them collectively together, we arrive at a 
proper and complete understanding of this work, i.e. everything there is to know about it. From the author's 
perspective, this level of understanding gives the reader a much broader perspective, and in fact a much 
better and complete understanding of the work itself.  While it includes the material aspects, it also includes 
the structural and formal aspects, as well as the teleological (the purpose)  aspects of the work as well.  
It is this last part, the purpose or meaning, that is actually almost entirely left out of any modern conception 
of reality in the West, conceptions that are grounded almost exclusively in the "physical" world and as such 
any sense of purpose is by definition excluded given that it has no empirical or objective value as such.  While 
causal determinism and objective realism are very powerful guiding intellectual principles that have done a 
great service to humanity by furthering the development of Science as a discipline unto itself, our blind faith 
in Science has in fact left us with a somewhat unintended byproduct of a much narrower, and less holistic 
and less descriptive in fact, notion of reality itself.  Hence the need for a revision of the underlying intellectual 
model as it were.  Back to first philosophy in some sense.
As a further illustration of the effect of the broadening of this definition of knowledge we can look at Part IV 
specifically with respect to "interpreting" Ramakrishna using a fundamentally Western intellectual 
epistemological lens, one that although is broadened to include and recognize Psychology, as a theoretical 
framework for understanding the mind and its effect on behavior specifically (Freudian psychology 
specifically) nonetheless comes with boundaries and assumptions that altogether prevent us from fully 
appreciating, or even comprehending, Ramakrishna as an historical figure who has had such a profound 
effect on theology and spirituality across the globe since his death at the end of the 19th century - most of 
which is due to the teachings and organizations established by his most well-known disciple Swami 
Vivekananda.
The Soul to Aristotle is viewed through this epistemological lens of causality, this broad definition which 
although is not unscientific necessarily, it is one nonetheless which includes not just the formal aspects of 
change, i.e. the model as it were of that which is being shaped, but also of course the final cause as well 
which represents the underlying purpose or meaning behind anything that we are trying to fully understand, 
appreciate or in turn whose very existence can be understood.  It is these last two aspects of causality that 
bring about the full meaning and appreciation of Paramhamsa Ramakrishna as a spiritual or religious figure, 
whose one true goal in life, the very reason or ultimate cause behind the sum total of his spiritual practices 
and his life in toto in fact, is the realization of God.  
This assumption regarding the existence of God, and his (or her as the case may be) realization as it were, is 
not abandoned or ignored in this epistemological framework, but is (at least according to later theological 
interpretations of Aristotle's metaphysics) integrated into the model as it were.  This is the notion of the 
prime, or first, mover, which is equated with God, or Allāh‎, by the Muslim philosophical tradition for example.  
As such, understanding the driving force, the true meaning and significance of Ramakrishna's spiritual 
practices using an Aristotelian epistemological lens, one can at least appreciate, and in turn interpret, his life 
and teachings within the context within which Ramakrishna himself lived as opposed to the somewhat 
contrived application of a Western intellectual materialistic and causally deterministic framework which 
invariably leads to confusion and/or total misinterpretation or misunderstanding.  
In other words, while causal determinism and objective realism are extraordinarily valuable and powerful 
tools for understanding the physical world, it is nonetheless entirely inadequate as an intellectual framework 
for not just Quantum Mechanics, but also as an intellectual framework for understanding the full scope of 
human existence - an existence which must include some level an appreciation or acceptance of the wisdom 
of the East as it were.  For it is from the wisdom of the East, of which traces can even be found in the ancient 
Western theo-philosophical tradition, that we find not just the fundamental belief in the existence of higher 
states of consciousness, i.e. supraconsciousness, but also the explicit belief that these states of consciousness 
can in fact be realized and that they in turn not only represent an aspect of reality, but also that they 
represent a higher order, or form, of reality itself - one which subsumes and transcends physical reality.  This 
is not only the basis for all mystical practices and the experiences associated therewith which are the legacy 
the Eastern philosophical tradition, the Indian philosophical tradition in particular, but also represent the 
core underlying message of all the prophets of all the ages, Ramakrishna being no exception of course.  
In brief, if the true nature of Being - an understanding of that which characterizes and underpins being in and

epistemological system must be sought.

The genesis of this work stemmed from an initial seed thought, an idea as it were.  A question really, "Is it 
possible that the basic metaphysics underlying the theo-philosophy of the ancient Chinese as well as the 
Greeks, stemmed from the same initial intellectual framework"?  If the answer was yes, or even maybe, it 
would push the date of the origins of theo-philosophy and metaphysics in antiquity much further back in 
history than previously considered - by a few millennia at least in fact.  This view is contrasted with the more 
orthodox view, the standard textbook view as it were, that these two belief systems evolved independently 
from each other.   
The question, while at first may seem almost moot given the lack of evidence available in the time period 
that would need to be understood in order to build evidence for such an outlandish hypothesis, actually upon 
reflection and a little bit of research seems not to be as altogether outrageous as one might think.  In fact, in 
light of the latest research surrounding the analysis and understanding of the human genome as it relates to 
the origination, and population, of the world by modern species of man along with a somewhat revolutionary 
hypothesis on the origins of mythology in antiquity as posited by the Vedic/Sanskrit scholar Michael Witzel, 
i.e. the so-called Laurasian hypothesis,  we find ourselves in the somewhat awkward position that this 
common origins hypothesis of what we term "Eurasian theo-philosophy" becomes at the very least possible, 
and perhaps even probable - given the extent of the intellectual similarities combined with the geographic 
disparity, or separation, of the civilizations within which these ancient theo-philosophical systems are first 
seen to emerge. 
By (re)aligning the study of the world's mythologies with the latest developments in human genetic research, 
linguistics, and archeology, Witzel theorizes that perhaps the similarities in mythological narrative that can be 
found across many disparate and geographically separated cultures and civilizations throughout the globe, 
both today in modern times as well as in ancient history, is due not to some collective unconscious, as 
theorized by Jung for example, but due to the "invention" and subsequent "spread" of what he refers to as a 
"Laurasian" mythological story line, i.e. what he refers to as a basic narrative,  by a male, shamanic based 
culture which spread in parallel to and aligned with the migration of modern humans out of Africa and into 
the Mediterranean, the Near East, the Indian subcontinent and the Far East (collectively what we refer to, 
following Witzel, as "Eurasia" throughout this work), i.e. the so-called Laurasian hypothesis. 
Irrespective of the strength or weakness of his hypotheses, a topic much too broad and involving too many 
disciplines that the author is in no position to speak critically about one way or another, this Laurasian 
hypothesis does rest on fairly sound developments with respect to genetic research specifically and human 
population migrations that have been widely accepted by the scientific community in the last twenty years or 
so.  This research stems not just from a detailed mapping of the human genome, but also by developments 
and discoveries in the rate of progression and "mutation" of Y chromosomes across generations (passed 
down on the paternal lineage) as well as the rate of mutation and progression of mitochondrial DNA (passed 
down on the maternal side), along with the mapping of the human genomes of various indigenous (i.e. 
relatively constant and non-itinerant) populations from across the globe over the last twenty years, all of 
which has provided the basis for sound empirical evidence of the following theories of human migration, 
revolutionizing our understanding of the history of mankind over the last 200,000 years or so.  
These revolutionary advancements in genetic research regarding the path of human migration across the 
globe out of Africa point to the following important facts, all relevant to the themes and related conclusions, 
if we may call them such, presented throughout this work:
a)	there existed a genetic bottleneck of sorts circa 100,000 years ago where the overall genetic diversity 
of modern humans, i.e. homo sapiens, was greatly reduced , 
b)	modern humans migrated out of Africa in waves starting around 75,000 years ago, initially 
populating the Near East and Southeast Asia by around 50,000 years ago and spreading all the way 
to Australia (through Indonesia presumably) by no later than ~46,000 years ago, and 
c)	this same "genetically affiliated" population of humans arrived in Europe ~43,000 years ago, 
supplanting the pre-existing Neanderthal populations there, and 
d)	these genetically distinguished modern humans reached and began to populate East Asia no later 
than 30,000 years ago and most likely by at least 40,000 years ago. 

Furthermore, we combine these facts with respect to what we now know of human migration across the 
globe in prehistory (i.e. before writing) through study of the human genome, with the evidence that begins to 
appear for Cave art drawings as well as Venus figurines in the archeological record starting around 40,000 
years ago across Europe, Asia and Australia, a picture begins to emerge of the potential diffusion of 
intellectual, and perhaps even theological, views across Eurasia in a more cohesive manner than is typically 
considered.
The existence of these "archeological" artifacts reflects at the very least the existence of abstract thought 
combined with basic tool making and language (the sum total of which arguably distinguish man, modern 
man, from the rest of the species on the planet as well as from his "less civilized and intelligent" 
predecessors) but also marks the beginning of the use of visual and material forms of "art" - shape, form, 
color and image to represent an "idea" - along with of course the existence of the technological 
developments necessary to create such "art" as well as the requisite intellectual developments (i.e. abstract 
thought, symbols, belief systems in and of themselves) for the creation of said symbols and arts in various 
forms.

 
Figure 1: Distribution of Cave Art in the Paleolithic Era throughout Eurasia 

This step in the evolution of modern man also importantly, and very relevantly to this work, marks the 
beginnings of mankind's perception of the world around them as "sacred" to a large extent.  For in these 
caves, we find colorful and descriptive scenes upon the walls of these cave which consist of various animals 
and beasts to which prehistoric man no doubt had a distinctive and powerful relationship to, but also 
distinctive hand markings and other half human and half animal type forms, similar to what we find in the 
depictions of Egyptian gods and goddesses for example.
These Cave art "spaces", and the other evidence within the caves themselves such as their location deep 
within the caves and the evidence of the use of fire along with the existence of bones of other species of 
animals along with the distinctive elaborate artwork itself, arguably represents the very first evidence we 
have for the establishment of a "sacred space" of sorts, where some form of ritual or ceremonial "worship", 
again if we may call it that, occurred and "symbols", mostly depicting animals and female archetypical 
images, begin to take on a life of themselves in some respect, becoming elements of "worship", again using 
that term in a broad sense.
It's important to note that just because the first evidence for this type of "thinking", if we may call it that, as 
reflected in these Cave art drawings and "sacred spaces" that we find evidence of in the Upper Paleolithic Era 
throughout Eurasia does not mean that the views and thoughts, the way of thinking or perception of man's 
relationship to their environment and the animals and natural environment and their surroundings, did not 
exist or was prevalent prior to the date of these findings only that we can definitively say that we do not have 
evidence of man's ability to create these images, the necessary tools and the requisite "mindset", prior to 
this time in human prehistory based upon archeological evidence as it exists right now.

These Cave art drawings show not only the importance and metaphysical symbiotic relationship that these 
early humans had with their "environment", in particular the animals that they relied on for sustenance and 
survival, but also some of the beginnings of the perception of the "mother" and "womb" as archaic elements 
of importance.  As we find not only depictions of the "mother" or "Venus" like figures on some of these Cave 
art paintings, but also the fairly widespread existence of so-called "Venus figurines" in the archeological 
record across Eurasia during the Upper Paleolithic as well.   
We then are presented with the evidence for the next major advancement in human civilization in the form 
of the invention of agriculture as well as the domestication of various animals, all developments that are 
characteristic of the so-called "Neolithic Revolution".  These developments first appear in the archeological 
record in the "Fertile Crescent" area in Southwest Asia  around 10,000 - 9,000 years ago and then spread 
throughout Europe and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent shortly thereafter, and to the Far East, 
i.e. Northern China and the Yellow River basin, by around 7,500 years ago.

The effect of these "technological" innovations and sociological advancements that characterize and 
ultimately define what historians refer to as the "Neolithic Revolution" on the structure of human society and 
the support it provided for the advancement and proliferation of modern humans in general throughout the 
world, and in particular in Eurasia, of course cannot be over-stated.  For as agriculture and farming becomes 
adopted, and the dominant source of food and sustenance migrates from meat, fish nuts and fruits and other 
forms of food that had dominated the diets of hunter-gatherer societies for centuries, millennia even, prior, 
more permanent and larger centers of habitation start to develop, towns and small urban centers, reflecting 
the transformation of man being subject to and under the dominion of his environment, i.e. Nature, to man 
beginning to take more control of his environment and learning how to manipulate it to enhance his chances 
for survival.  It is this more sedentary lifestyle that is primarily considered to be the cornerstone of 
specialization which in turn facilitated the proliferation of modern humans throughout this region in antiquity 
and this in turn led to further social and technological advancements, ultimately leading up to the invention 
of writing after which we begin to have written records of course which give us much greater insight into 
ancient man. 
During this time period throughout Eurasia we see the development of large towns and small urban centers 
and the advent again of specialization, where individuals and societies as a whole begin to advance more 
special roles and skills which allow for the further advancement of knowledge and technology in general 
which of course facilitates the so-called "advancement" of society and "civilization" in general.  At this time, 
the social structure of these ancient peoples begins to become more stratified, and a distinction arises not 
just between individuals responsible for ruling and governing and those that are governed, but also the 
people that are responsible for "doing the work" so to speak, and those that were in charge of, or managed, 
those doing the work, as well as the development of a specific warrior class as well that was responsible for 
defending (or expanding) one's territory as the case may be.  
Lastly, as part of this stratification of society, this specialization as it were, we see the development of a 
"scholarly" or "priestly" class, probably an outgrowth of the ancient shamans, who were not only responsible 
for presiding over special forms of ceremonial worship but were also responsible for communing with the 
spirits and ancestors, as well as "divining" the will of the gods or spirits and performing the necessary 
sacrifices and ceremonies to "appease" these entities to bring about, and ensure, good fortune.  This is for 
example the social stratification we see in the ancient Vedic literature, what is referred to as Varna. 
The invention of agriculture and the domestication of animals and the advent of a more stable form of 
society, the beginnings of "civilization" as we understand it today in fact, marks the end of the Upper 
Paleolithic and ushers in the Neolithic Era, a time period of rapid innovation and human expansion 
throughout the globe and especially in North Africa, the Fertile Crescent, the Indian subcontinent and in the 
Far East - i.e. what we refer to as "Eurasia" in this work primarily.  
From an intellectual perspective, what we find from the archeological records throughout this region during 
this era of rapid human expansion and evolution is not just technological advancements of the use of stone 
tools for various means of construction of more sophisticated homes and towns, complex building structures 
and systems of irrigation a well as the development of more advanced forms of weaponry and more 
sophisticated forms of pottery for example, but also the development of more sophisticated and complex 
places of worship, or again "sacred spaces".  We find evidence of this for example in the creation of the 
Megaliths ", or large stone structures or monuments, during this time, in particular in Europe (Stonehenge 
being of course the most famous example) but also throughout the Near East and into the Far East as well - 
again Eurasia - representing one of the archeological hallmarks of the earliest forms of "civilization".   
These developments no doubt reflect the evolution of mankind's relationship to his environment as more 
"religious", or "sacred", to a large extent, and these early forms of "worship", which are reflected in their 
very earliest form in the Upper Paleolithic "Cave art" drawings, and then come to have a more concrete 
manifestation in the Megalithic structures, many of which have been shown to have an astronomical 
significance, start to shape and form the basis, the connecting force as it were, for the various peoples in the 
various regions throughout Eurasia.  Religion in its earliest form in fact, was "naturalistic", in the sense that 
various forms of nature were appealed to, were worshipped, so that they would "produce" and "support" the 
necessary means of survival for the respective cultures and societies that developed.  It wasn't until later in 
the development of more advanced forms of civilization, in what is typically referred to as the Bronze Age, 
where we see the first elements of proto writing as well as more advanced forms of metallurgy (hence the 
name Bronze Age).  It's also during this period of human evolution, in the earliest forms of "civilization", 
where we start to see in the archeological records not just more advanced and elaborate forms of "religious 
structures", but also evidence for more advanced forms of ceremonial "worship".  
Alongside these archeological developments we of course find parallel social developments where a specific 
class of society develops to support this critical function, i.e. what we now call "priests" or "shamans", but 
whose function was to preside over the various "religious" rites and ceremonies which from a certain 
perspective formed the heart of these early societies.  These individuals not only had intimate knowledge of 
the "spirit world", the world of deceased ancestors, but also had divinatory or fortune telling type skills, 
where they could read various omens and provide guidance on when the best time it was to wage war, plant 
crops or make sacrifices to the "gods", and also in many cases were healers, or medicine men, as well.  As 
disease in antiquity was primarily looked upon as a form of "spiritual" ill or the possession by some sort of 
evil spirit. 
These developments, in particular the growing importance of agriculture in the survival and success of these 
civilizations as they start to emerge throughout Eurasia, forces these early peoples, the harbinger of the 
modern "civilization", to come to a much clearer and better understanding of the nature of the cycles of the 
Earth and the seasons, and no doubt caused the ancient peoples to come to a greater reliance on the nature 
of water and irrigation as the ultimate source and sustenance of life.  Necessity is the mother of invention as 
we know so well.  We see these developments, this reliance and obsession with the importance of these 
"natural" resources and cycles in the survival and sustenance of these early civilizations throughout Eurasia 
reflected in the early mythological narratives that we find associated with these early peoples once the 
written records start to emerge, once writing is developed and these early myths are written down and 
"standardized", or "canonized", as it were.   These ancient peoples all worshipped the sun, the earth and the 
moon, and also in some early societies the planet Venus as well whose clear visibility in the night sky and 
whose cycles and rhythms, along with the moon of course, came to represent not just the feminine rhythms 
of creation, preservation and "rebirth" but also came to symbolize fertility as well.   
We find the early creation stories from the earliest written records across all of Eurasia really, for the most 
part without exception started with the notion of a "watery abyss" from which a semblance of order and the 
first pantheon of gods emerge, from which the heaven and the earth are ultimately formed.  It is during this 
time period that we find evidence for the first astronomical observations and evidence for fairly sophisticated 
predictability of various seasonal events which undoubtedly represented a fundamental aspect of these 
people's survival.
This "Neolithic Revolution" ushered in what is referred to as the Bronze Age of human history, a time period 
throughout Eurasia which is characterized not just by the invention of much more sophisticated means and 
methods of the creation of tools, advanced weaponry, pottery and more sophisticated forms of agriculture 
and irrigation techniques, but also the invention of writing in the 3rd and 2nd millennium BCE after which 
"history", replaces "pre-history" and first-hand accounts, i.e. the written word or inscription, becomes the 
primary source (combined with archeology of course as well) of our understanding of how these people in 
antiquity thought, lived and behaved within the context of their environment.  A new age had dawned and 
man had now become "civilized" in the modern sense of the term. 
We find evidence for the existence of various forms of sophisticated language, and writing, from at least 
4,000 BCE onwards , a development that coincides with the end of the Neolithic Era of human history and 
occurs within a thousand years or so across all of Eurasia.  It is this archeological evidence and the similarities 
in man's perspective on the world as reflected in the earliest forms and symbols that we find throughout 
Eurasia in the Upper Paleolithic, as well as the earliest written records from all of these disparate and 
geographically separated peoples and societies, along with the now firm genetic evidence that speaks to the 
common ancestry of these people who settled throughout Eurasia in prehistory, that begs the question that 
is stated earlier in this Prologue - namely: does Witzel's Laurasian hypothesis as it applies to mythos, 
specifically creation mythos, hold water and in turn is it possible that it can be extended, intellectually 
speaking, to apply to theo-philosophy as well as mythos?
If we were to ask this question twenty or thirty years ago the answer would be a resounding "No!" and you 
would no doubt not find a single scholar who was willing to put forth such a foolish thought without entirely 
suspending reason.  However, given the advancements in the fields referred to described above, along with 
the work of some scholars who have proposed direct connections between and among the ancient mythos 
and intellectual strains of thought between the ancient Sumer-Babylonians, Indo-Aryans and ancient early 
Greeks (the Hellenes), combined with Witzel's work which draws parallels both linguistically, genetically and 
mythologically between and among these peoples across the entire Eurasian region in antiquity, it does beg 
the question as to when how far back in history can these narrative lines, these ancient mythologies, and in 
turn these ancient theo-philosophies, be drawn, and when the art of expression, i.e. spoken language, is 
actually born to carry with it consistent and persistent symbolic thought.
It's not an enormous intellectual leap to hypothesize that the first stories that are told, and are preserved, 
are the mythological narratives that Witzel specifically analyzes, what we have come to refer to as "myth".  
But mythology morphs and is interwoven into theology deep in antiquity and arguably the two domains of 
study as we delineate them today, do not split from each other until much after the advent of the written 
word, and in turn philosophy, in the latter part of the first millennium BCE.  In other words, if any symbolic 
set of thoughts, words or ideas were to be preserved and/or spread amongst these early Upper Paleolithic 
populations of modern man which we have ample evidence now that had and were spreading throughout 
Eurasia during the Upper Paleolithic (c. 50,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago until the advent of the Bronze 
Age), it would in fact be the kind of ideas, figures, shapes, symbols and relationships that we find being 
explored by the Pre-Socratic philosophers as well as the original authors and interpreters of the Yìjīng.  
Hence the question as to what extent the core, underlying symbolic representations of these seemingly 
disparate philosophical systems are fundamentally similar and if so to what extent can this similarity 
potentially be explained by a shared common ancestry that reaches much further back into prehistory than is 
commonly thought, believed or taught by modern scholarship in ancient history.  For what is clear, and for 
which there exists no evidence whatsoever, is that there was very little if any direct cultural exchange, 
intellectual economic or otherwise, between the civilizations of the Mediterranean and Near east and the Far 
East across the virtually impenetrable Himalayan mountain range in the first millennium BCE when the first 
written records appear in these respective civilizations throughout "Eurasia".   
Therefore, if any strong patterns of similarity and analogy could be drawn between the seed theo-
philosophical systems of these geographically separated and culturally distinct civilizations, once could make 
a strong argument, i.e. the Laurasian hypothesis, that these similarities are due to the spread or diffusion of 
similar ideas by prior generations of men rather than distinct inventions by two separate and vastly different 
intellectual centers of development if we can call them such.
